PLAYSTYLE

Glass cannon precision damage dealer. Position yourself at range for optimal weakspot shots. Use Patient Hunter's aiming stacks (aim for 2.25 seconds for max +30% damage). Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer (+15% max). With Jim, prioritize precision kills to stack Clean Kill (+25% max) but avoid taking damage to maintain stacks. Use Assault Rifles or LMGs for Tactical Vest bonus and Suppressing Fire utility. Stay at range, aim for weakspots, and let your massive damage do the work. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire.


STRENGTHS

- Massive damage potential (up to +103% with Jim, +88% with Walker)
- High weakspot damage focus (especially with Jim's +10% team weakspot)
- Excellent penetration (+225%) for hitting multiple targets
- Good ammo capacity (+55%) for sustained fire
- Team utility during hordes
- Fast reload speed (+65% with Jim)


WEAKNESSES

- Very low health pool (+15) - one mistake can be fatal
- Requires good aiming/positioning to maximize damage stacks
- Vulnerable if caught in close quarters
- Needs teammates for protection
- With Jim: Clean Kill stacks reset on taking damage
- Patient Hunter requires aiming time - vulnerable during stack building
