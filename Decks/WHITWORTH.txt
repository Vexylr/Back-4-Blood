DECK STRATEGY:
--------------

All cards are active from the start, so you benefit from everything immediately.

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (Active from Level Start):
- Base damage bonuses stack: Combat Training (+5%), Large Caliber (+7.5%), Silver Bullets (+10%), Ammo Pouch (+2.5%) = +23% base
- All penetration stacks: Line 'Em Up (+25%), Large Caliber (+200%) = +225% total
- Range bonuses active: Line 'Em Up (+10% range), Silver Bullets (+15% range) = +25% total
- Fresh Bandage triggers at start of each level (trauma and health recovery)
- All utility bonuses active: reload speed, aim speed, movement speed

STACKING MECHANICS (Build During Combat):
- Patient Hunter: Stacks while aiming (0.75 sec per stack, up to 3 stacks = +30% damage)
- Confident Killer: Stacks on mutation kills (up to 15 stacks = +15% damage, lasts until end of level)
- Jim's Clean Kill: Stacks on precision kills (up to 10 stacks = +25% damage, resets on taking damage)

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Damage Group: Patient Hunter + Confident Killer + Tactical Vest + Combat Training + Large Caliber + Silver Bullets
  → Multiple damage sources stack for massive output
- Precision Group: Patient Hunter + Line 'Em Up + Jim's Seasoned Hunter (if using Jim)
  → Focus on weakspot shots for maximum effectiveness
- Mobility Group: Dash + Cross Trainers + On Your Mark
  → Movement and positioning for optimal shots
- Utility Group: Fresh Bandage + Down in Front! + On Your Mark
  → Sustain and team support

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Glass cannon precision damage dealer. Position yourself at range for optimal weakspot shots. Use Patient Hunter's aiming stacks (aim for 2.25 seconds for max +30% damage). Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer (+15% max). With Jim, prioritize precision kills to stack Clean Kill (+25% max) - but avoid taking damage to maintain stacks. Use Assault Rifles or LMGs for Tactical Vest bonus (+10% damage) and Suppressing Fire utility (40% slow chance). Stay at range, aim for weakspots, and let your massive damage do the work. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire. Your goal: eliminate 70%+ of a Breaker's health single-handedly through precision weakspot damage.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Low health pool (+15) means positioning is critical - stay at range
- All damage bonuses active from start, but stacks require combat engagement
- Fresh Bandage provides crucial trauma/health recovery at level start
- Patient Hunter requires aiming time (2.25 sec for max stacks) - position safely
- Confident Killer stacks on mutations - prioritize special kills early
- With Jim: Clean Kill requires precision AND avoiding damage - high skill requirement
- With Walker: More forgiving with consistent +10% damage and team health boost
- Penetration allows hitting multiple targets, maximizing efficiency
- Team utility (On Your Mark, Jim's Seasoned Hunter) makes you valuable beyond just damage

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best precision weapon (M1A, Phoenix, or high-damage AR/LMG)
2. Scope attachments for weakspot targeting
3. Penetration attachments to maximize Large Caliber Rounds
4. Medical accessories (low health pool needs backup sustain)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Massive damage potential (up to +103% with Jim, +88% with Walker)
- High weakspot damage focus (especially with Jim's +10% team weakspot)
- Excellent penetration (+225%) for hitting multiple targets
- Good ammo capacity (+55%) for sustained fire
- Team utility during hordes (On Your Mark provides team buffs)
- Precision kill synergy with Jim's Clean Kill (if played well)
- Fast reload speed (+65% with Jim, +40% base)

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Very low health pool (only +15 health) - one mistake can be fatal
- Requires good aiming/positioning to maximize damage stacks
- Vulnerable if caught in close quarters
- Needs teammates for protection while you deal damage
- With Jim: Clean Kill stacks reset on taking damage - requires skill to maintain
- Patient Hunter requires aiming time - vulnerable during stack building
