PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Rifle specialist using M1A or Ranch Rifle. Ranch Rifle is more reliable as it's guaranteed at starting level. Optics Enthusiast provides massive weakspot damage (+75%) for precision shots. Glass Cannon gives high damage but reduces health - offset by trauma resistance (65%) and sustain. Use bash periodically to maintain Meth Head stacks. Battle Lust heals from bash/melee kills. Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management. Hip-fire accuracy build with Quick Kill. Use offhand SMG ammo weapon for versatility. Goal: precision damage with weakspot focus while maintaining sustain.

STRENGTHS:
----------

- High damage output (+35% base + 75% weakspot)
- Excellent trauma resistance (65%)
- Reliable weapon (Ranch Rifle available at start)
- Good sustain through kills and food
- Fast reload speed
- High hip-fire accuracy
- Mobility while firing
- Weakspot damage resistance

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Low health pool (-30% from Glass Cannon)
- No fire resistance (-100%)
- Requires maintaining Meth Head stacks with bash
- Requires precision aiming for maximum effectiveness
- Can replace slot 15 (Silver Bullets) with other options

COMMUNITY NOTES:
----------------

- Ranch Rifle is more reliable variant (guaranteed at starting level)
- Melee cards work with bash/knife for common ridden clearing
- Use bash against Ridden, main weapon against mutations to preserve ammo
- Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng's abilities
- Replace Food Scavenger if not using Heng
