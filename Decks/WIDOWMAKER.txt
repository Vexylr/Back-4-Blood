PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Precision rifle specialist using M1A or Ranch Rifle with Aim Down Sights. Ranch Rifle is more reliable as it's guaranteed at starting level. Optics Enthusiast provides massive weakspot damage (+75%) and Front Sight Focus adds another +10% weakspot damage for +85% total. Patient Hunter stacks while aiming (+30% damage when fully scoped). Glass Cannon gives high damage (+57.5% base) but reduces health (-30%) - partially offset by health cards and trauma resistance (65%). Aim Down Sights and hold scope for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks. Fresh Bandage provides passive trauma/health recovery at level start. Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for enhanced food healing. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire. Goal: precision weakspot shots from range while maintaining sustain through food and trauma resistance.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Trauma is a major threat - this deck has 65% trauma resistance (excellent!)
- Glass Cannon reduces health (-30% base, -20% net with health cards) - need sustain through food
- All trauma resistance active from level start - you're protected from first engagement
- Fresh Bandage provides crucial trauma/health recovery at level start (15 trauma + health restore)
- Patient Hunter requires aiming time (2.25 sec for max stacks) - position safely
- Massive weakspot damage (+85%) allows rapid mutation elimination when hitting weakspots
- Food Scavenger + Heng provides enhanced food healing throughout levels
- High damage output helps kill enemies before they deal damage
- No fire resistance (net -80%) - avoid fire damage when possible
- Requires precision aiming - practice weakspot shots for maximum effectiveness

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best precision rifle (M1A or Ranch Rifle - Ranch Rifle guaranteed at start)
2. Scope attachments for weakspot targeting
3. Penetration attachments to maximize Large Caliber Rounds
4. Food items (for sustain, especially with Heng)
5. Medical accessories (backup sustain)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Massive damage output (+52.5% base + up to +30% when scoped + +85% weakspot = incredible damage potential)
- Excellent weakspot damage (+85% total - best possible)
- Excellent trauma resistance (65%)
- Reliable weapon (Ranch Rifle available at start)
- Can Aim Down Sights for precision shots (no ADS-disabling cards!)
- Good sustain through food and Fresh Bandage

- High accuracy (+20%) and recoil control (+30%) for precision shots
- Extended range (+25%) for safer positioning
- Bullet penetration (+225%) for hitting multiple targets
- Weakspot damage resistance (+50%) reduces weakspot vulnerability
- With Heng: Enhanced food synergy and food sensing

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Lower health pool (-20% net health from Glass Cannon)
- No fire resistance (net -80% - Wooden Armor -100% + Durable +20%)
- Requires precision aiming for maximum effectiveness (weakspot shots essential)
- Patient Hunter requires aiming time (2.25 sec for max stacks) - vulnerable during scope time
