Ultimate tank and revive specialist. Your massive health pool (110+ health) and damage resistance allow you to stand in the open while reviving teammates. Use Smelling Salts for lightning-fast revives even under heavy fire. Pep Talk makes your revives heal teammates and reduce incoming damage (-4 total damage reduction while reviving). With Dan, you get random effects on every revive and team damage resistance during revives. Your role is to be the last person standing, able to revive the entire team during horde events. Stay near teammates to use your revive bonuses effectively. Position yourself to take aggro and protect squishier teammates.
