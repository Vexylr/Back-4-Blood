SPARTAN BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Ultimate tank and revive specialist. Your massive health pool (110+ health) and 
damage resistance let you stand in the open while reviving teammates. You're the 
last person standing, able to revive the entire team during horde events.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing tank. Position yourself to take aggro and protect squishier 
teammates. Your job is reviving teammates quickly and safely. Use Smelling Salts 
for lightning-fast revives (+200% speed) even under heavy fire. Pep Talk makes 
your revives heal teammates and reduce incoming damage (-4 total damage 
reduction while reviving).

Stay near teammates to use your revive bonuses effectively. Position yourself to 
take aggro - you have massive health and damage resistance, so let enemies attack 
you instead of squishier teammates. Crouch when near teammates with Down in 
Front! to prevent friendly fire.

REVIVE MECHANICS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Smelling Salts
  → Gives +200% revive speed - you can revive teammates incredibly fast even 
    under fire

Pep Talk
  → Reduces incoming damage by 3 while reviving (combined with Scar Tissue's 
    -1 flat = -4 total damage reduction while reviving)
  → Teammates gain +10 health when you revive them

SURVIVABILITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Health Pool: 110+ health
  → Can take incredible punishment

Damage Resistance: +15%
  • Motorcycle Jacket (+5%)
  • Padded Suit (+10%)

Damage Reduction:
  • -1 flat from all Ridden (Scar Tissue)
  • -3 additional while reviving (Pep Talk)
  • Total: -4 while reviving

Trauma Resistance: +35%
  • Body Armor (+20%)
  • Durable (+15%)

Combined, you're incredibly tanky.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use LMGs for penetration and mutation control - ALL IN on LMGs. Your damage 
output is modest - focus on survival and revives, let DPS builds handle 
mutations. Good stumble damage helps with crowd control.

STAMINA PENALTIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Canned Goods reduces stamina by 25% and Padded Suit reduces stamina efficiency 
by 20%. This limits your mobility, but you don't need to move much - position 
yourself and let enemies come to you.

TEAM SUPPORT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Well Fed
  → Gives +10 team health

Pep Talk
  → Heals teammates when you revive them (+10 health each)

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Dan
  → Random effects play whenever a Cleaner is Revived (Divine Intervention)
  → You get +3 team damage resistance during revives (Protect the Flock)
  → This makes Dan perfect for this build - every revive becomes more valuable
  → Note: Available in Children of the Worm expansion

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't focus on damage - let DPS builds handle that

✗ Don't abandon teammates - your job is to revive them
✗ Don't waste your health - trauma can still accumulate over time
✗ Don't forget to use Pep Talk during revives
