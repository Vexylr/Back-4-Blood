FLORENCE BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Primary healer and medical support specialist. Your goal is keeping everyone's 
health bar green. Maximum healing efficiency (+90% with Doc) makes you the most 
effective healer possible. Every medical item use provides multiple benefits to 
the entire team.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing healer/support. Use Support Scavenger to find medical items, 
then use them with maximum efficiency (+90% with Doc). Group Therapy makes every 
medical use heal the whole team (+8 health each). Field Surgeon handles trauma 
(+3 trauma per use), and Antibiotic Ointment provides temp health (+20 temp 
health per use).

Position yourself safely - stay mobile with Dash and Energy Bar, but don't put 
yourself in danger. Your job is keeping the team alive, so stay alive yourself. 
Crouch when near teammates with Down in Front! to prevent friendly fire while 
healing.

HEALING EFFICIENCY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

With Doc, you have +90% healing efficiency (+75% base + 15% Skilled Physician). 
This means medical items heal for almost double their normal amount. Combined 
with all the additional effects, every medical use is incredibly valuable.

HEALING EFFECTS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

When you use a medical accessory:
  • Target heals: Normal amount × 1.90 (+90% efficiency)
  • All teammates heal: +8 Health (Group Therapy)
  • Target gains: +3 Trauma healing (Field Surgeon)

  • You heal: 50% of what target receives (Charitable Soul)

Every medical use is a team buff - use them proactively, not just reactively.

DOC'S FIELD MEDIC

This gives you 3 free heals per level without consuming items. Use these 
strategically for emergencies when items are scarce.
