SPRINGFIELD BUILD GUIDE

OVERVIEW
--------

Precision rifle specialist using M1A or Ranch Rifle with Aim Down Sights. Focused on massive weakspot damage (+85% total) for rapid mutation elimination. High trauma resistance (65%) offsets Glass Cannon's health penalty, making you durable despite the health reduction.

HOW TO PLAY
-----------

Your role is precision DPS. Use Aim Down Sights and hold your scope for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks (+30% damage when fully scoped). Aim for weakspots to maximize your +85% weakspot damage bonus. Position at range and eliminate mutations efficiently.

WEAPONS:

Use M1A or Ranch Rifle. Ranch Rifle is more reliable as it's guaranteed at starting level. These precision rifles work perfectly with your weakspot damage focus. Optics Enthusiast gives +75% weakspot damage, and Front Sight Focus adds another +10% for +85% total.

AIMING:

Aim Down Sights and hold for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks. This gives you up to +30% additional damage when fully scoped. Position safely before scoping - you're vulnerable while aiming.

Focus on weakspot shots. Your +85% weakspot damage makes precision shots incredibly effective. Optics Enthusiast also gives +50% weakspot damage resistance, reducing your vulnerability to weakspot shots.

POSITIONING:

Stay at range for optimal weakspot shots. Position safely before scoping for Patient Hunter stacks. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire while scoped.

SUSTAIN:

Fresh Bandage heals 15 trauma and restores health at level start - crucial since Glass Cannon reduces your health (-20% net). Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for enhanced food healing throughout levels.

WITH HENG:

More Food spawns, you gain effects when teammates eat food, and food restores +1 trauma when you consume it. Team gains +1 health and stamina per food consumed. This food synergy provides excellent sustain.

TRAUMA RESISTANCE:

You have 65% trauma resistance (Wooden Armor + Body Armor + Durable) - excellent protection. This offsets Glass Cannon's health penalty and keeps you durable on high difficulties. All trauma resistance is active from level start.

DAMAGE OUTPUT:

Base damage is +52.5% (Glass Cannon + Tactical Vest + Silver Bullets + Large Caliber). Add up to +30% when scoped (Patient Hunter). Combined with +85% weakspot damage, you deal incredible damage to mutations when hitting weakspots.

WHAT TO DO:

1. Get Ranch Rifle or M1A early
2. Position at range for weakspot shots
3. Aim down sights for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks
4. Focus on weakspot shots for maximum damage
5. Use food for sustain (especially with Heng)
6. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!)
7. Use Fresh Bandage for sustain at level start
8. Take advantage of +200% penetration to hit multiple targets

WHAT NOT TO DO:

- Don't waste weakspot damage on body shots (aim for weakspots)
- Don't ignore food (important for sustain with Heng)
- Don't scope unsafely (vulnerable during Patient Hunter stacking)
- Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-80% net) - avoid fire damage
- Don't play aggressively (stay at range)
- Don't ignore positioning (requires safe spots for scoping)

SUMMARY:

You're a precision rifle specialist. Position at range, scope for 2.25 seconds to stack Patient Hunter, and aim for weakspots to maximize your +85% weakspot damage. Your high trauma resistance keeps you durable despite Glass Cannon's health penalty. With Heng, food synergy provides excellent sustain. Your goal: eliminate mutations efficiently through precise weakspot shots.
