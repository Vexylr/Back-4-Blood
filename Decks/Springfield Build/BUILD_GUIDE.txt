SPRINGFIELD BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Precision rifle specialist using M1A or Ranch Rifle with Aim Down Sights. 
Focused on massive weakspot damage (+85% total) for rapid mutation elimination. 
High trauma resistance (65%) offsets Glass Cannon's health penalty, making you 
durable despite the health reduction.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing precision DPS. Use Aim Down Sights and hold your scope for 2.25 
seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks - this gives you up to +30% additional 
damage when fully scoped. Aim for weakspots to maximize your +85% weakspot 
damage bonus. Position at range and eliminate mutations efficiently.

Stay at range for optimal weakspot shots. Position safely before scoping for 
Patient Hunter stacks. Crouch when near teammates with Down in Front! to 
prevent friendly fire while scoped.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

M1A or Ranch Rifle
  → Ranch Rifle is more reliable since it's guaranteed at starting level
  → These precision rifles work perfectly with your weakspot damage focus
  → Optics Enthusiast gives +75% weakspot damage
  → Front Sight Focus adds another +10% for +85% total

DAMAGE CALCULATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Base Damage: +45%
  • +25% Glass Cannon
  • +10% Tactical Vest (AR/LMG)
  • +10% Silver Bullets

Additional Bonuses:
  • Up to +30% when scoped (Patient Hunter)

Weakspot Damage: +85% total
  • +75% Optics Enthusiast
  • +10% Front Sight Focus

TRAUMA RESISTANCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have 65% trauma resistance from:
  • Wooden Armor (+30%)
  • Body Armor (+20%)
  • Durable (+15%)

This offsets Glass Cannon's health penalty and keeps you durable on high 
difficulties. All trauma resistance is active from level start.

SUSTAIN
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Fresh Bandage
  → Heals 15 trauma and restores health at level start - crucial since Glass 
    Cannon reduces your health (-20% net)

Food Scavenger
  → Synergizes with Heng for enhanced food healing throughout levels

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Heng
  → More Food spawns, you gain effects when teammates eat food, and food 
    restores +1 trauma when you consume it
  → Your team gains +1 health and stamina per food consumed
  → This food synergy provides excellent sustain

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Get Ranch Rifle or M1A early
✓ Position at range for weakspot shots
✓ Aim down sights for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks
✓ Focus on weakspot shots for maximum damage
✓ Use food for sustain, especially with Heng
✓ Crouch when near teammates
✓ Use Fresh Bandage for sustain at level start
✓ Take advantage of +200% penetration to hit multiple targets

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't waste weakspot damage on body shots - aim for weakspots
✗ Don't ignore food - it's important for sustain with Heng
✗ Don't scope unsafely - you're vulnerable during Patient Hunter stacking
✗ Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-80% net) - avoid fire damage
✗ Don't play aggressively - stay at range
✗ Don't ignore positioning - you need safe spots for scoping

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're a precision rifle specialist. Position at range, scope for 2.25 seconds 
to stack Patient Hunter, and aim for weakspots to maximize your +85% weakspot 
damage. Your high trauma resistance keeps you durable despite Glass Cannon's 
health penalty. With Heng, food synergy provides excellent sustain. Your goal 
is eliminating mutations efficiently through precise weakspot shots.
