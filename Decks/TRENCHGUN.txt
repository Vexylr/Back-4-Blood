DECK STRATEGY:
--------------

All cards are active from the start, so you benefit from everything immediately.

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (Active from Level Start):
- High damage output (+25% Glass Cannon) active from start
- All trauma resistance stacks: Wooden Armor (+30%), Body Armor (+20%), Motorcycle Helmet (+15%) = 65% total
- All reload and accuracy bonuses active immediately
- Glass Cannon health reduction (-30%) active from start - need sustain

STACKING MECHANICS (Build During Combat):
- Meth Head: Stacks on each swing (up to 10 stacks = +50% speed/efficiency) - maintain with periodic bash

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Damage Group: Glass Cannon + Mean Drunk + Spiky Bits
  → High damage output (+25% + melee bonuses)
- Defense Group: Wooden Armor + Body Armor + Motorcycle Helmet + Spiky Bits + Hunker Down
  → Trauma resistance (65%) and damage resistance
- Sustain Group: Buckshot Bruiser + Battle Lust + Food Scavenger + Heng's food synergy
  → Multiple healing sources
- Speed Group: Meth Head + Brazen + Mag Coupler + Hellfire
  → Attack speed, reload speed, and movement speed

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Shotgun specialist focusing on AA12 with hip-fire accuracy. Glass Cannon gives massive damage (+25%) but reduces health (-30%) - offset by high trauma resistance (65%) and sustain cards. Use bash periodically to maintain Meth Head stacks for stamina efficiency. Crouch when firing for better pellet grouping (Hunker Down provides +10% accuracy and damage resistance while crouched). Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet). Battle Lust heals from bash/melee kills (+1 health + 0.125 trauma per kill). Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management - Heng gains effects when teammates eat food, and food provides enhanced healing. Use Magnum as offhand for mutations. Goal: high damage output while maintaining sustain through kills and food.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Trauma is a major threat - this deck has 65% trauma resistance (excellent!)
- Glass Cannon reduces health (-30%) - need sustain through kills and food
- All trauma resistance active from level start - you're protected from first engagement
- Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits - AA12 fires many pellets
- Battle Lust provides trauma healing during combat (0.125 trauma per kill)
- Food Scavenger + Heng provides enhanced food healing throughout levels
- High damage output helps kill enemies before they deal damage
- No fire resistance (-100%) - avoid fire damage when possible
- Requires maintaining Meth Head stacks with bash for optimal stamina efficiency
- Must find AA12 early for optimal performance

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. AA12 shotgun (must find early for optimal performance)
2. Magnum (offhand for mutations)
3. Food items (for sustain, especially with Heng)
4. Medical accessories (backup sustain)

----------

- High damage output (+25% Glass Cannon)
- Excellent trauma resistance (65% - best possible)
- Good sustain through kills and food
- Fast reload speed (+50%)
- High hip-fire accuracy (+50% + crouch bonus)
- Mobility while firing (+45% move speed)

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Low health pool (-30% from Glass Cannon)
- No fire resistance (-100% from Wooden Armor)
- Requires maintaining Meth Head stacks with bash
- Needs to find AA12 early for optimal performance
- Requires Heng for best food synergy
