PLAYSTYLE

Belgian specialist with unlimited ammo through Ammo Stash (Belgian is a secondary weapon). Extremely high trauma resistance (80%) and damage resistance (+35% while crouched) make you very tanky. Very fast reload speed (+130% total) compensates for Ammo Stash penalty (20% slower base reload). Crouch for additional defense and accuracy. Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet, 12 pellets = 3 temp health per hit if all connect). Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management. Down in Front! prevents friendly fire when crouched.
