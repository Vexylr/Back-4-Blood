SAWED OFF BUILD GUIDE

OVERVIEW
--------

Belgian shotgun specialist with unlimited ammo (Belgian is a secondary weapon). Extremely tanky with 80% trauma resistance and +35% damage resistance while crouched. Your job is to use the Belgian for unlimited ammo while maintaining high survivability through tankiness and sustain.

HOW TO PLAY
-----------

Your role is DPS/frontliner. Use the Belgian as your secondary weapon - it has unlimited ammo through Ammo Stash. Crouch when firing for optimal defense (+35% damage resistance total while crouched). Your extremely high trauma resistance (80%) makes you very durable despite the close-range nature of the Belgian.

POSITIONING:

Crouch when firing and when near teammates. Hunker Down provides +10% accuracy and +10% damage resistance while crouched, and you already have +25% base damage resistance (Padded Suit + Motorcycle Helmet) for +35% total while crouched. This makes you very tanky.

WEAPONS:

Belgian as secondary (unlimited ammo). Use any primary weapon for mutations - you're focused on the Belgian for common ridden clearing. You can't aim down sights (Mag Coupler, Motorcycle Helmet disable ADS), so hip-fire only.

UNLIMITED AMMO:

Ammo Stash gives unlimited ammo to secondary weapons. The Belgian reloads 20% slower base, but you have +130% reload speed total (Scattergun Skills + Mag Coupler + Widemouth Magwell), so reloading is still very fast.

SUSTAIN:

Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet, 12 pellets = 3 temp health per hit if all connect). Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management. Fit as a Fiddle gives +20% team bolstered health and +5 team health.

TRAUMA RESISTANCE:

You have 80% trauma resistance (Wooden Armor + Body Armor + Durable + Fanny Pack) - the best possible trauma resistance in the game. This makes you incredibly durable on high difficulties.

DAMAGE RESISTANCE:

+25% base (Padded Suit + Motorcycle Helmet) + +10% while crouching (Hunker Down) = +35% total while crouched. Combined with +25 health and 80% trauma resistance, you're very tanky.

WITH HENG:

Food synergy is excellent. More Food spawns, you gain effects when teammates eat food, and food restores +1 trauma when you consume it. Team gains +1 health and stamina per food consumed. This provides excellent sustain.

WHAT TO DO:

1. Use Belgian as secondary (unlimited ammo)
2. Crouch when firing for optimal defense (+35% damage resistance)
3. Use primary weapon for mutations
4. Use food for sustain (especially with Heng)
5. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!)
6. Reload quickly with +130% reload speed
7. Stay in close range (Belgian is close-range weapon)

WHAT NOT TO DO:

- Don't try to aim down sights (you can't - hip-fire only)
- Don't forget to crouch (optimal defense requires crouching)
- Don't waste food (important for sustain with Heng)
- Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-80% net) - avoid fire damage
- Don't play at long range (Belgian is close-range)

SUMMARY:

You're a Belgian shotgun specialist with unlimited ammo. Crouch when firing for optimal defense (+35% damage resistance) and use your extremely high trauma resistance (80%) to tank damage. Your fast reload speed (+130%) compensates for Ammo Stash penalty. With Heng, food synergy provides excellent sustain. Your goal: use unlimited Belgian ammo to clear common ridden while maintaining high survivability through tankiness.
