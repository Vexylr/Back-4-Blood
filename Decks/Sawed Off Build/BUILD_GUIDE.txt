SAWED OFF BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Belgian shotgun specialist with unlimited ammo (Belgian is a secondary weapon). 
Extremely tanky with 80% trauma resistance and +35% damage resistance while 
crouched. Your job is using the Belgian for unlimited ammo while maintaining 
high survivability through tankiness and sustain.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing DPS/frontliner. Use the Belgian as your secondary weapon - it 
has unlimited ammo through Ammo Stash. Crouch when firing for optimal defense 
(+35% damage resistance total while crouched). Your extremely high trauma 
resistance (80%) makes you very durable despite the close-range nature of the 
Belgian.

Crouch when firing and when near teammates. Hunker Down provides +40% accuracy 
and +10% damage resistance while crouched, and you already have +25% base 
damage resistance from Padded Suit and Motorcycle Helmet for +35% total while 
crouched. This makes you very tanky.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Secondary: Belgian (unlimited ammo)
  → Use any primary weapon for mutations - you're focused on the Belgian for 
    common ridden clearing
  → You can't aim down sights (Mag Coupler, Motorcycle Helmet disable ADS), so 
    hip-fire only

UNLIMITED AMMO MECHANICS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Ammo Stash gives unlimited ammo to secondary weapons. The Belgian reloads 20% 
slower base, but you have +130% reload speed total from Scattergun Skills, Mag 
Coupler, and Widemouth Magwell, so reloading is still very fast.

TRAUMA RESISTANCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have 80% trauma resistance from:
  • Wooden Armor (+30%)
  • Body Armor (+20%)
  • Durable (+15%)
  • Fanny Pack (+15%)

This is the best possible trauma resistance in the game. This makes you 
incredibly durable on high difficulties.

DAMAGE RESISTANCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have +25% base damage resistance from Padded Suit and Motorcycle Helmet, 
plus +10% while crouching from Hunker Down, for +35% total while crouched. You 
get +40% accuracy while crouching from Hunker Down. Combined with +25 health 
and 80% trauma resistance, you're very tanky.

SUSTAIN
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Ammo Scavenger
  → Ensures you have ammo for your unlimited Belgian ammo needs

Food Scavenger
  → Synergizes with Heng for trauma management

Well Rested
  → Gives +20% team overheal and +5% team healing efficiency

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Heng
  → Food synergy is excellent. More Food spawns, you gain effects when 
    teammates eat food, and food restores +1 trauma when you consume it
  → Your team gains +1 health and stamina per food consumed
  → This provides excellent sustain
  → Note: Available in Tunnels of Terror expansion

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Use Belgian as secondary (unlimited ammo)
✓ Crouch when firing for optimal defense (+35% damage resistance)
✓ Use primary weapon for mutations
✓ Use food for sustain, especially with Heng
✓ Crouch when near teammates
✓ Reload quickly with +130% reload speed
✓ Stay in close range - Belgian is a close-range weapon

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't try to aim down sights - you can't, it's hip-fire only
✗ Don't forget to crouch - optimal defense requires crouching
✗ Don't waste food - it's important for sustain with Heng
✗ Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-80% net) - avoid fire damage
✗ Don't play at long range - Belgian is close-range

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're a Belgian shotgun specialist with unlimited ammo. Crouch when firing for 
optimal defense (+35% damage resistance) and use your extremely high trauma 
resistance (80%) to tank damage. Your fast reload speed (+130%) compensates for 
Ammo Stash penalty. With Heng, food synergy provides excellent sustain. Your 
goal is using unlimited Belgian ammo to clear common ridden while maintaining 
high survivability through tankiness.
