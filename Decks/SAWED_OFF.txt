DECK STRATEGY:
--------------

All cards are active from the start, so you benefit from everything immediately.

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (Active from Level Start):
- Best possible trauma resistance (80%) active from start
- All reload speed bonuses active (+130% total)
- Unlimited ammo active (Belgian is secondary, Ammo Stash)
- All defensive bonuses active

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Reload Group: Scattergun Skills + Mag Coupler + Widemouth Magwell
  → Incredibly fast reload speed (+130%)
- Defense Group: Motorcycle Helmet + Wooden Armor + Body Armor + Durable + Fanny Pack + Padded Suit + Hunker Down
  → Trauma resistance (80%) and damage resistance (+35% while crouched)
- Sustain Group: Buckshot Bruiser + Food Scavenger + Heng's food synergy
  → Multiple healing sources
- Utility Group: Ammo Stash + Down in Front! + Food Scavenger
  → Unlimited ammo, friendly fire protection, and food generation

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Belgian specialist with unlimited ammo through Ammo Stash (Belgian is a secondary weapon). Extremely high trauma resistance (80%) and damage resistance (+35% while crouched) make you very tanky. Scattergun Skills provides reload bonuses (+40% with shotguns). Very fast reload speed (+130% total) compensates for Ammo Stash penalty (20% slower base reload). Crouch for additional defense and accuracy (Hunker Down provides +10% damage resistance + +10% accuracy while crouched). Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet, 12 pellets = 3 temp health per hit if all connect). Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management - Heng gains effects when teammates eat food, and food provides enhanced healing. Down in Front! prevents friendly fire when crouched. Goal: tanky shotgun build with unlimited ammo and high survivability.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Trauma is a major threat - this deck has 80% trauma resistance (excellent!)
- All trauma resistance active from level start - you're protected from first engagement
- Unlimited ammo (Belgian secondary) means no ammo management needed
- Fast reload speed (+130%) allows rapid sustained fire
- Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits - Belgian fires 12 pellets per shot
- Food Scavenger + Heng provides enhanced food healing throughout levels
- High health pool (+25) provides survivability
- Crouch for optimal defense (+35% damage resistance total while crouched)
- No fire resistance (net -80%) - avoid fire damage when possible

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Belgian (secondary weapon - guaranteed availability)
2. Primary weapon for mutations (any AR/LMG/SMG)
3. Food items (for sustain, especially with Heng)
4. Medical accessories (backup sustain)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Excellent trauma resistance (80% - very high)
- Unlimited ammo (Belgian secondary, Ammo Stash)
- Fast reload speed (+130% - incredibly fast)
- Good sustain through kills and food
- Temp health generation from shotgun hits (Buckshot Bruiser - 12 pellets per shot)
- High health pool (+25 health)

- With Heng: Enhanced food synergy and food sensing

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Negative fire resistance (net -80% - Wooden Armor -100% + Durable +20%)
- Requires maintaining crouch for optimal defense
- Belgian is close-range weapon (limited range)
- Requires Heng for best food synergy
- DISABLES: Aim Down Sights (Mag Coupler, Motorcycle Helmet) - hip-fire only
