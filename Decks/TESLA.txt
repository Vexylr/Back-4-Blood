Experimental tech specialist using DLC gadgets. Your gadgets replace item slots but cost ammo instead of consumables. Expired T5 is your main offensive tool (20 fire damage to weakspots). Ultrasonic Wound Therapy provides team healing. Experimental Stimulants buffs team damage and reload speed. Crippling Frequency reduces incoming damage. Experimental Stun Gun gives crowd control but makes you fragile. Use Ammo Scavenger and high ammo capacity to fuel your gadgets. Copper Scavenger generates copper for upgrades and item purchases. Your goal: use experimental tech to dominate, but manage ammo carefully as gadgets are expensive.
