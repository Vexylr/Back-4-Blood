PLAYSTYLE

Shotgun specialist focusing on AA12 with hip-fire accuracy. Glass Cannon gives massive damage (+25%) but reduces health (-30%) - offset by high trauma resistance (65%) and sustain cards. Use bash periodically to maintain Meth Head stacks for stamina efficiency. Crouch when firing for better pellet grouping (Hunker Down provides +10% accuracy and damage resistance while crouched). Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet). Battle Lust heals from bash/melee kills (+1 health + 0.125 trauma per kill). Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management. Use Magnum as offhand for mutations.


STRENGTHS

- High damage output (+25%)
- Excellent trauma resistance (65%)
- Good sustain through kills and food
- Fast reload speed (+50%)
- High hip-fire accuracy (+50% + crouch bonus)
- Melee sustain for common ridden (bash/knife with Battle Lust)
- With Heng: Enhanced food synergy and food sensing


WEAKNESSES

- Low health pool (-20% net)
- No fire resistance (-100%)
- Requires maintaining Meth Head stacks with bash
- Needs to find AA12 early for optimal performance
- DISABLES: Aim Down Sights (hip-fire only)
