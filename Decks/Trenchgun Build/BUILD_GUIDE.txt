TRENCHGUN BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Shotgun specialist using the AA12 with hip-fire accuracy. High damage output, 
excellent trauma resistance (65%), and sustain through temp health, food, and 
team healing. Your job is dealing damage while maintaining survivability through 
sustain cards and positioning.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing DPS/frontliner. Use the AA12 as your primary weapon with 
hip-fire - you can't aim down sights. Crouch when firing for better pellet 
grouping and damage resistance. Use your fast reload speed and movement speed 
while firing to maintain constant pressure.

Crouch when firing - Hunker Down provides +40% accuracy and +10% damage 
resistance while crouched. Combined with Quick Kill's +50% accuracy, you get 
+90% accuracy while crouching. This improves pellet grouping and makes you 
tankier. Crouch when near teammates with Down in Front! to prevent friendly 
fire.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Primary: AA12
  → You need to find it early for optimal performance
  → Mag Coupler and Quick Kill disable ADS, so hip-fire only

Secondary: Magnum
  → Use as offhand for mutations

SUSTAIN MECHANICS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Buckshot Bruiser
  → Provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet). The AA12 fires 
    many pellets, so you get significant temp health.

Amped Up
  → Provides team healing during hordes (+20 health)

Fresh Bandage
  → Provides trauma and health recovery at level start (15 trauma + health 
    restore)

Food Scavenger
  → Provides additional food items for sustain

TRAUMA RESISTANCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have 50% trauma resistance from:
  • Wooden Armor (+30%)
  • Body Armor (+20%)

This keeps you durable on high difficulties.

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Holly
  → Health regeneration from melee kills (Battle Lust: +2 health per kill)
  → Team stamina support (+25 team stamina from Cardio)
  → Team damage resistance (+5% team damage resistance from Tough as Nails)
  → Guide recommends Holly on shotguns (preferably AA12)
  → With the right cards, you can intelligently use her health regeneration ability and convert it to temporary health

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Find AA12 early - it's critical for optimal performance
✓ Crouch when firing for better accuracy (+90% while crouching) and damage 
  resistance
✓ Use Magnum for mutations
✓ Use food for sustain
✓ Crouch when near teammates
✓ Stay aggressive - use your movement speed while firing to kite enemies and 
  maintain pressure

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't try to aim down sights - you can't, it's hip-fire only
✗ Don't waste food - it's important for sustain
✗ Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-100%) - avoid fire damage
✗ Don't play at long range - shotgun is close-range
✗ Don't forget to crouch - optimal accuracy and defense require it

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're an AA12 shotgun specialist. Crouch when firing for maximum accuracy 
(+90%) and defense (+25% damage resistance while crouched), and use your 
movement speed while firing to kite enemies. Your high trauma resistance (50%) 
keeps you durable. With Holly, health regeneration from melee kills provides 
excellent sustain, and you can convert it to temporary health with proper cards. 
Your goal is dealing sustained damage with the AA12 while maintaining 
survivability through temp health, food, and team healing.
