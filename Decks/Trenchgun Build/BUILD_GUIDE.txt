TRENCHGUN BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Shotgun specialist using the AA12 with hip-fire accuracy. High damage output, 
excellent trauma resistance (65%), and sustain through temp health, food, and 
team healing. Your job is dealing damage while maintaining survivability through 
sustain cards and positioning.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing DPS/frontliner. Use the AA12 as your primary weapon with 
hip-fire - you can't aim down sights. Crouch when firing for better pellet 
grouping and damage resistance. Use your fast reload speed and movement speed 
while firing to maintain constant pressure.

Crouch when firing - Hunker Down provides +40% accuracy and +10% damage 
resistance while crouched. Combined with Quick Kill's +50% accuracy, you get 
+90% accuracy while crouching. This improves pellet grouping and makes you 
tankier. Crouch when near teammates with Down in Front! to prevent friendly 
fire.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Primary: AA12
  → You need to find it early for optimal performance
  → Mag Coupler and Quick Kill disable ADS, so hip-fire only

Secondary: Magnum
  → Use as offhand for mutations

SUSTAIN MECHANICS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Buckshot Bruiser
  → Provides temp health from shotgun hits (0.25 per pellet). The AA12 fires 
    many pellets, so you get significant temp health.

Amped Up
  → Provides team healing during hordes (+20 health)

Fresh Bandage
  → Provides trauma and health recovery at level start (15 trauma + health 
    restore)

Food Scavenger
  → Synergizes with Heng for trauma management

TRAUMA RESISTANCE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have 65% trauma resistance from:
  • Wooden Armor (+30%)
  • Body Armor (+20%)
  • Motorcycle Helmet (+15%)

This offsets Glass Cannon's health penalty and keeps you durable on high 
difficulties.

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Heng
  → More Food spawns, you gain effects when teammates eat food, and food 
    restores +1 trauma when you consume it
  → Your team gains +1 health and stamina per food consumed
  → This food synergy provides excellent sustain

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Find AA12 early - it's critical for optimal performance
✓ Crouch when firing for better accuracy (+90% while crouching) and damage 
  resistance
✓ Use Magnum for mutations
✓ Use food for sustain, especially with Heng
✓ Crouch when near teammates
✓ Stay aggressive - use your movement speed while firing to kite enemies and 
  maintain pressure

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't try to aim down sights - you can't, it's hip-fire only
✗ Don't waste food - it's important for sustain with Heng
✗ Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-100%) - avoid fire damage
✗ Don't play at long range - shotgun is close-range
✗ Don't forget to crouch - optimal accuracy and defense require it

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're an AA12 shotgun specialist. Crouch when firing for maximum accuracy 
(+90%) and defense, and use your movement speed while firing to kite enemies. 
Your high trauma resistance offsets Glass Cannon's health penalty. With Heng, 
food synergy provides excellent sustain. Your goal is dealing sustained damage 
with the AA12 while maintaining survivability through temp health, food, and 
team healing.
