- Maximum movement speed bonuses active (up to +75% while firing with SMG)
- High stamina pool and regeneration active
- All speed bonuses stack immediately
- Breakout capability active (30s cooldown)

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Speed Group: Hellfire + Speed Demon + Energy Drink + Dash + Cross Trainers
  → Maximum movement speed while maintaining combat effectiveness
- Stamina Group: Cross Trainers + Energy Bar + Energy Drink + Mandatory PT
  → High stamina pool and regeneration for constant movement
- Damage Group: Mag Carrier + Silver Bullets + Large Caliber + Ammo Pouch + Front Sight Focus
  → Good damage output while maintaining speed
- Utility Group: Utility Scavenger + Breakout + Karlee's abilities
  → Hazard detection, item access, and solo survivability

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Fast-moving scout that runs ahead to clear obstacles, detect hazards, and report back to team. With Karlee, sense sleepers and traps (Knowledge is Power) to prevent team wipes, and sense Tool Kits (Hack It) for objectives. Use SMGs for maximum speed bonuses (up to +75% movement speed while firing). Your incredible movement speed lets you kite enemies and escape dangerous situations. Breakout ensures you can escape grabs when separated from team (30s cooldown, enhanced with Evangelo). Your role: clear the path, detect threats, and handle yourself solo when needed. Stay mobile, stay ahead, but don't abandon the team completely. Use your speed to kite mutations and common ridden while team focuses fire.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Movement speed is crucial for avoiding damage - this build maximizes speed
- Low health pool (+10) means positioning and movement are critical
- Breakout capability (30s cooldown) provides solo survivability when separated
- With Karlee: Hazard detection prevents team wipes from sleepers/traps
- High stamina pool and regen allows constant movement and kiting
- Good damage output allows you to contribute while scouting
- Team stamina support (Mandatory PT) benefits entire team
- Utility Scavenger ensures tool kit availability for objectives
- Can get separated from team - need to balance scouting with team coordination

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best SMG (for Speed Demon synergy and movement speed)
2. Stun Gun (Karlee starts with one, utility for escapes)
3. Tool kits (for objectives, especially with Karlee's Hack It)
4. Quick slot items (Utility Scavenger generates these)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Incredible movement speed (up to +75% while firing with SMG)
- High stamina pool (+35% + team support) and regeneration (+50-85%)
- Solo survivability (Breakout with 30s cooldown, enhanced with Evangelo)
- Hazard detection with Karlee (prevents team wipes)
- Good damage output (+22.5% base + weakspot damage) while maintaining speed
- Quick item access (Utility Scavenger generates Quick Accessories)
- Team stamina support (Mandatory PT)

- With Evangelo: Enhanced breakout capability + team movement speed

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Very low health pool (+10 health only)
