PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Mobile supplier and resource generator. Your job is to keep the team stocked with ammo, weapons, and items. Use all your scavenger cards to find and generate resources throughout each level. Stay mobile with Cross Trainers, help with damage using your weapon cards, and support the team through resource generation. With Hoffman, provide massive ammo support (+50% team ammo capacity) and generate offensive items through kills. Bounty Hunter provides copper (up to 300 per level) for team upgrades. Avenge the Fallen gives emergency power (30% damage, 20% reload, unlimited ammo for 10 seconds) when teammates go down. Saferoom Recovery provides team sustain at level start. You're the portable merchant keeping everyone supplied and stocked.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Resource management is crucial on high difficulties - your scavenger abilities ensure team has supplies
- Team ammo support (+50% with Hoffman) prevents ammo starvation
- Copper generation (Bounty Hunter) funds team upgrades and item purchases

- Avenge the Fallen provides emergency power when things go wrong (unlimited ammo + damage boost)
- With Hoffman: Item generation from kills supplements scavenger finds
- Good damage output allows you to contribute to combat while supporting
- Multiple scavenger abilities ensure resource availability throughout levels

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best weapon for mutation control (AR/LMG for Suppressing Fire synergy)
2. Ammo capacity attachments (maximize team ammo support)
3. Resource items (share copper and items with team)
4. Tool kits (for team utility and saferoom upgrades)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Multiple scavenger abilities (Ammo, Weapon, Offensive, Copper) for complete resource generation
- Massive team ammo support (+50% team capacity with Hoffman)
- Copper generation for upgrades (up to 300 per level with Bounty Hunter)

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Lower personal health pool (+15 health only)
- Requires active scavenging to maximize effectiveness
- Less focused than specialized builds (jack of all trades)
- Team-dependent for optimal utility (needs team to benefit from resources)
- Moderate damage output (support role, not primary DPS)
