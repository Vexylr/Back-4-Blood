SPARTACUS BUILD GUIDE

Frontline melee tank that clears common ridden for the team. High damage, excellent sustain through healing on kills, and good trauma resistance make you a durable frontline fighter. Your job is handling hordes, clearing common ridden efficiently, and healing your team through kills.
