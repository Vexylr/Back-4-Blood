DYNAMITE BUILD GUIDE

OVERVIEW
--------

Professional demolitionist and explosive specialist. Your grenades and Molotovs deal massive damage (+175% total). Your job is to eliminate bosses and mutations with explosive damage. You're the boss elimination specialist.

HOW TO PLAY
-----------

Your role is DPS. Use your offensive items (grenades, Molotovs) to deal massive damage to bosses and mutations. Save offensive items for important targets - use your secondary weapon with unlimited ammo for common ridden. With Hoffman, you have +4 offensive inventory slots.

EXPLOSIVE DAMAGE:

Your explosive damage is +175% total (Demolitions Expert +50%, Grenade Training +25%, Bomb Squad +25% team, Pyro +100% fire damage). This makes your grenades and Molotovs incredibly powerful. Combined with Pyro's +100% fire damage, Molotovs are especially devastating.

ITEM GENERATION:

Use Offensive Scavenger to find items, Money Grubbers and Copper Scavenger for purchasing power. Highwayman gives 5% chance to spawn ammo/Molotov/Bait Jar on secondary kills. With Hoffman, Always Prepared generates items from kills. This ensures you have items available.

ITEM CAPACITY:

With Hoffman, you have +4 offensive inventory slots (+3 base + 1 Ready to Rock). This means more items available per level. Belt Clip also gives +1 quick slot inventory.

SUSTAIN:

Pyro gives +3 temp health per fire kill. Fire in the Hole! gives 20 temp health + 25% sprint speed for 5 seconds when throwing offensive items. Canned Goods gives +45 health (partially offsetting stamina penalty). This provides good survivability.

FIRE DAMAGE:

Pyro makes fire damage incredibly powerful (+100%). Molotovs become especially effective. You can sense flammable objects nearby, which helps with positioning fire attacks.

TEAM SUPPORT:

Bomb Squad gives +25% team explosive damage and +25% team explosive resistance. This helps the entire team when using explosives. +1 Frag Grenade spawns per map provides additional utility.

SECONDARY WEAPON:

Use secondary weapon with unlimited ammo (Ammo Stash) for common ridden clearing. Save your primary weapon for mutations, but focus on using offensive items for damage.

WITH HOFFMAN:

+4 offensive inventory slots means more items available. +15% team ammo capacity helps mitigate Demolitions Expert's -15% ammo penalty. Always Prepared generates items from kills. Starts with Ammo Pack for team utility.

WHAT TO DO:

1. Use Offensive Scavenger to find items
2. Collect copper for item purchases (Copper Scavenger, Money Grubbers)
3. Save offensive items for bosses and mutations
4. Use secondary weapon with unlimited ammo for common ridden
5. Use Pyro for fire damage (+100% fire damage)
6. Use Fire in the Hole! for sustain when throwing items
7. Take down bosses and mutations with explosive damage
8. Communicate when you're using items for coordination

WHAT NOT TO DO:

- Don't waste offensive items on common ridden (use secondary weapon)
- Don't ignore item generation (need to find/purchase items)
- Don't forget fire resistance is negative (-100% from Wooden Armor) - but this build doesn't use Wooden Armor
- Don't forget stamina penalty (-25% from Canned Goods)
- Don't ignore copper management (need copper for item purchases)

SUMMARY:

You're the explosive specialist. Use your massive explosive damage (+175%) to eliminate bosses and mutations efficiently. With Hoffman, you have +4 offensive inventory slots and generate items from kills. Your goal: take down Breakers and Ogres with ease using your explosive damage bonuses. Use secondary weapon for common ridden, save offensive items for important targets.
