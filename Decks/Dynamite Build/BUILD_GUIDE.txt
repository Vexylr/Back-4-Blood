You're playing DPS. Use your offensive items (grenades, Molotovs) to deal massive damage to bosses and mutations. Save offensive items for important targets - use your secondary weapon with unlimited ammo for common ridden. With Hoffman, you have +4 offensive inventory slots.

Your explosive damage is +175% total from Demolitions Expert, Grenade Training, Bomb Squad, and Pyro. This makes your grenades and Molotovs incredibly powerful. Combined with Pyro's +100% fire damage, Molotovs are especially devastating.

Use Offensive Scavenger to find items. Money Grubbers and Copper Scavenger provide purchasing power. Highwayman gives 5% chance to spawn ammo/Molotov/Bait Jar on secondary kills. With Hoffman, Always Prepared generates items from kills. This ensures you have items available.

With Hoffman, you have +4 offensive inventory slots (+3 base + 1 Ready to Rock). This means more items available per level. Belt Clip also gives +1 quick slot inventory.

Pyro gives +3 temp health per fire kill. Fire in the Hole! gives 20 temp health + 25% sprint speed for 5 seconds when throwing offensive items. Canned Goods gives +45 health (partially offsetting stamina penalty). This provides good survivability.

Pyro makes fire damage incredibly powerful (+100%). Molotovs become especially effective. You can sense flammable objects nearby, which helps with positioning fire attacks.
