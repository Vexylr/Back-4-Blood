PLAYSTYLE

The ultimate one-shot survivable build. Combines maximum damage output with damage resistance and health to avoid being one-shotted. Glass Cannon provides +25% damage but reduces health (-30%), offset by Walker's +10 team health and Padded Suit's +5 health and +10% damage resistance. Hyper-Focused, Ridden Slayer, and Front Sight Focus give massive weakspot damage (+80%, +90% with Jim) for one-shotting mutations. Position yourself at range for optimal weakspot shots. Use Patient Hunter's aiming stacks (aim for 2.25 seconds for max +30% damage). Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer (+15% max). With Walker, ping mutations for 10% reduced damage from them. With Jim, prioritize precision kills to stack Clean Kill (+25% max) but avoid taking damage to maintain stacks. Admin Reload lets you swap weapons for instant reloads - perfect for sustained fire. Run Like Hell provides mobility (+12% move speed, +15% sprint speed) - enough for survival. Use Assault Rifles for Tactical Vest bonus - ALL IN on ARs. Stay at medium range, aim for weakspots, and let your massive damage do the work. The +10% damage resistance from Padded Suit means you take 10% less damage from all sources, significantly improving survivability.

NOTE: Per guide recommendations, ensure at least one teammate has On Your Mark (ammo), Needs of the Many + Medical Professional (lives/health), and Amped Up (healing). This deck focuses on damage - team support cards should be handled by other players.
