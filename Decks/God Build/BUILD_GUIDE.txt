GOD BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The ultimate survivable AR DPS build. Combines maximum damage output with 
damage resistance and health to avoid being one-shotted while still maintaining 
the power to eliminate mutations quickly. This build balances the glass cannon 
approach with practical survivability - you deal massive damage but won't die 
from a single mistake. ARs provide more versatility than snipers at medium range.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing DPS with survivability. You have significant damage resistance 
(+10%) and 85 health with Walker (vs 70 health pure glass cannon), making you 
much more durable while still maintaining massive damage output. Position 
yourself at medium range for optimal weakspot shots - ARs are more forgiving 
than snipers and work better in close-to-medium range engagements.

Stay at medium range when possible, but don't fear taking some damage. The +10% 
damage resistance from Padded Suit means you take 10% less damage from all 
sources, significantly improving your survivability compared to pure glass 
cannon builds. ARs are more versatile than snipers and work in more situations.

DAMAGE STACKING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Patient Hunter
  → Aim down sights and hold for 2.25 seconds to max your stacks
  → Gives you +30% damage when fully scoped
  → Requires staying still while aiming, so position safely before scoping

Confident Killer
  → Stacks on mutation kills, giving you up to +15% damage
  → Prioritize killing mutations early to build stacks quickly

Clean Kill (Jim only)
  → Stacks on precision kills for up to +25% damage
  → Resets if you take damage
  → Requires skill - hit weakspots consistently and avoid taking damage

DAMAGE CALCULATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Base Damage: +52.5% from cards
  • +25% Glass Cannon
  • +7.5% Large Caliber Rounds
  • +10% Silver Bullets
  • +10% Tactical Vest (ARs)

With Walker:
  • +10% Model Soldier = +62.5% base
  • Up to +30% from Patient Hunter (scoped)
  • Up to +15% from Confident Killer (mutation kills)
  • Total: Up to +107.5% damage potential

With Jim:
  • +52.5% base
  • Up to +30% from Patient Hunter (scoped)
  • Up to +15% from Confident Killer (mutation kills)
  • Up to +25% from Clean Kill (precision kills)
  • Total: Up to +122.5% damage potential

WEAKSPOT DAMAGE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

+80% Weakspot Damage (cards):
  • +50% Hyper-Focused
  • +20% Ridden Slayer
  • +10% Front Sight Focus

With Jim: +90% (+80% cards + +10% Team Weakspot from Seasoned Hunter)

This massive weakspot damage combined with your base damage multipliers means 
you can one-shot most mutations with a well-placed weakspot shot.

SURVIVABILITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Health Calculation (with Walker):
  • Base: 100 health
  • Glass Cannon: -30% = 70 health
  • Walker's Pragmatic: +10 team health (flat) = 80 health
  • Padded Suit: +5 health = 85 health total

Damage Resistance:
  • +10% from Padded Suit (all damage sources)
  • +10% reduced damage from pinged mutations (Walker's Incoming! trait)

This means:
  • You have 21% more health than pure glass cannon builds (85 vs 70)
  • You take 10% less damage from all sources
  • You take 10% less damage from mutations you ping (with Walker)

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use Assault Rifles. Tactical Vest gives +10% damage with ARs and +30% rifle 
ammo capacity. M4 Carbine, SCAR, AK47, or RPK work great. ARs provide excellent 
damage output with more versatility than snipers - they work at medium range 
and are more forgiving in close encounters. Combined with your massive damage 
multipliers, ARs eliminate mutations quickly while maintaining flexibility.

RECOMMENDED CLEANERS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Walker (Primary)
  → +10 flat team health offsets some of Glass Cannon's penalty (85 vs 75 with Jim)
  → +10% consistent damage bonus
  → Ping mutations for 10% reduced damage from them
  → More forgiving and survivable

Jim (Alternative)
  → Highest damage potential with Clean Kill (+25% max)
  → +10% team weakspot damage
  → +25% reload speed
  → Requires skill to maintain stacks (resets on taking damage)

UTILITY & SUSTAIN
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Admin Reload
  → Automatic reload on weapon swap
  → Enables constant weapon swapping for sustained fire
  → Perfect for maintaining damage output during hordes

Run Like Hell
  → +12% move speed and +15% sprint speed
  → Provides enough mobility for survival
  → Benefits lost for 3 seconds when taking damage

Copper Scavenger + Money Grubbers
  → Economy cards for team upgrades
  → Money Grubbers can provide up to 75 additional copper per level
  → Essential for purchasing upgrades and items

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Position at range for optimal weakspot shots
✓ Aim down sights for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks
✓ Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer
✓ Prioritize weakspot shots for one-shot potential
✓ With Walker: Ping mutations before engaging for 10% damage reduction
✓ Use Admin Reload to maintain constant fire
✓ Take advantage of +10% damage resistance - you can take some hits

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't get overconfident - you're more durable than glass cannon, but still 
  fragile compared to tank builds
✗ Don't waste ammo - manage it carefully
✗ Don't ignore positioning - range and cover are still important
✗ With Jim: Don't take unnecessary damage or you'll reset Clean Kill stacks
✗ Don't forget to stack Patient Hunter by aiming for 2.25 seconds
✗ Don't forget to ping mutations with Walker for 10% damage reduction

ELIMINATION POTENTIAL
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

With maximum stacks and weakspot shots, you can eliminate mutations extremely 
quickly:
  • Stingers - 1-2 shots
  • Stalkers - 1-2 shots
  • Hockers - 1-2 shots
  • Retches - 1-2 shots
  • Exploders - 1-2 shots
  • Tallboys - 2-3 shots (with weakspot focus)
  • Reekers - 2-3 shots

While not one-shotting like snipers, ARs provide faster follow-up shots and 
more versatility. Bosses require sustained fire, but you'll deal massive damage 
with each weakspot hit, making boss fights much faster.
