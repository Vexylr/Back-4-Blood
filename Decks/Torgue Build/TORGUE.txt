PLAYSTYLE

Glass cannon sniper specialist with team utility focus. Glass Cannon provides +25% damage but reduces health significantly (-30%), making positioning critical. Stock Pouch gives +10% sniper damage and +30% sniper ammo capacity. Use Patient Hunter's aiming stacks (aim for 2.25 seconds for max +30% damage). Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer (+15% max). With Jim, prioritize precision kills to stack Clean Kill (+25% max) but avoid taking damage to maintain stacks. Hyper-Focused gives massive weakspot damage (+50%) but slows you by 40% while shooting - position safely before engaging. ALL IN on Snipers - use sniper rifles exclusively to maximize Stock Pouch bonus.

Team support via Amped Up (+20 health per horde), On Your Mark (ammo + speed during hordes), and Needs Of The Many (1 extra life) make you valuable beyond just damage. Crouch when near teammates (Down In Front!) to prevent friendly fire. Your good ammo capacity (+55% for snipers) and reload speed during hordes (+30%) allow sustained fire. Large Caliber Rounds penetration (+200%) and Silver Bullets range (+15%) help clear multiple enemies at distance.

- Fast reload speed during hordes (+30%)

- Requires good aiming/positioning to maximize damage stacks
- Vulnerable if caught in close quarters or overwhelmed
- Needs teammates for protection due to low health
- With Jim: Clean Kill stacks reset on taking damage - must avoid damage to maintain
- Patient Hunter requires aiming time (2.25 seconds for max stacks) - vulnerable during stack building
