WEAPONS

ALL IN ON SNIPERS
  • Primary Weapon: Use sniper rifles exclusively (Phoenix, M1A, Ranch Rifle, Barrett)
  • Stock Pouch provides +10% damage and +30% ammo capacity specifically for snipers
  • Patient Hunter works best with sniper rifles - you'll be aiming anyway
  • Hyper-Focused weakspot damage synergizes perfectly with sniper precision

AMMO MANAGEMENT
  • +80% sniper ammo capacity (Ammo Belt + Stock Pouch)
  • Ammo Scavenger ensures ammo availability
  • Use On Your Mark during hordes for 7.5% ammo restore
  • Your massive capacity means you can sustain fire without worrying about ammo

PLAYSTYLE

POSITIONING IS CRITICAL
  • Glass Cannon (-30% health) and Needs Of The Many (-10% health) = -40% total health penalty
  • You have very low health - one mistake can be fatal
  • Position at range, use cover, stay behind teammates
  • Never lead the charge - let tanks/melee handle front line
  • Crouch when near teammates (Down In Front!) to prevent friendly fire

DAMAGE STACKING
  • Patient Hunter: Aim for 2.25 seconds to get max +30% damage (3 stacks)
  • Confident Killer: Kill mutations to stack +1% damage per kill (up to +15%)
  • With Jim: Clean Kill stacks +25% from precision kills (reset on taking damage)
  • Hyper-Focused: +50% weakspot damage (always active when shooting weakspots)
  • Stock Pouch: +10% sniper damage (always active)

WEAKSPOT FOCUS
  • Hyper-Focused gives +50% weakspot damage (+60% with Jim's team bonus)
  • Always aim for weakspots - that's where your damage comes from
  • With sniper rifles, weakspots are easier to hit
  • Patient Hunter stacks while aiming - perfect for sniper gameplay

TEAM SUPPORT
  • Amped Up: Team gains +20 health every horde
  • On Your Mark: Team restores 7.5% ammo and gains speed/reload buffs during hordes
  • Needs Of The Many: Team gets 1 extra life (incredibly valuable on No Hope)
  • Well Rested: +20% team overheal, +5% team healing efficiency
  • Copper Scavenger: Ensures copper for team upgrades
  • Food Scavenger: Provides food for team sustain

MOBILITY MANAGEMENT
  • Hyper-Focused reduces move speed by 40% while shooting
  • This means you're very slow during combat - position before engaging
  • Don't try to kite while shooting - you'll move too slowly
  • Use cover and positioning instead of mobility
  • During hordes, On Your Mark gives +10% move speed while firing to partially offset

STRENGTHS

✓ Massive damage output (up to +112.5% with Jim, +97.5% with Walker)
✓ High weakspot damage (+50-60%)
✓ Excellent team utility (extra life, horde support, overheal)
✓ High ammo capacity (+80% for snipers)
✓ Excellent penetration (+200%) for multi-kills

WEAKNESSES

✗ Very low health pool (-40% net) - extremely fragile
✗ Hyper-Focused slows you 40% while shooting - vulnerable during combat
✗ Requires excellent positioning and map knowledge
✗ Needs teammates for protection
✗ With Jim: Clean Kill stacks reset on taking damage - must avoid all damage
✗ Patient Hunter requires 2.25 seconds of aiming - vulnerable during stack building
✗ No mobility cards (removed Run Like Hell) - rely on positioning only

TIPS

• Always position first, shoot second - your slow movement while shooting means you can't reposition easily
• Use Down In Front! religiously - your damage is so high you'll kill teammates easily
• Prioritize mutations for Confident Killer stacks
• With Jim: Focus on precision kills but avoid ALL damage to maintain Clean Kill stacks
• Use cover extensively - you can't take many hits
• Let teammates handle common ridden - you focus on mutations and specials
• Your team support cards make you valuable even if you're not top damage
• Needs Of The Many extra life is incredibly valuable - don't underestimate team utility
• Copper Scavenger ensures the team can afford upgrades - help the team succeed
• Food Scavenger provides sustain - share food with team

DIFFICULTY NOTES

Nightmare/No Hope: This build excels on high difficulty where:
  • Team extra life from Needs Of The Many is invaluable
  • High damage is essential for mutations
  • Weakspot focus is critical for specials
  • Team support becomes more important
  • Positioning matters more due to lower health

COMMON MISTAKES

✗ Standing in the open while aiming (vulnerable during Patient Hunter stacking)
✗ Trying to kite while shooting (Hyper-Focused penalty makes this impossible)
✗ Not using Down In Front! (friendly fire will kill teammates)
✗ Leading the charge (you're too fragile)
✗ Not maintaining Patient Hunter stacks (losing out on +30% damage)
✗ Ignoring team support role (you're more than just damage)
