PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Belgian specialist with unlimited ammo through Ammo Stash (Belgian is a secondary weapon). Extremely high trauma resistance (95%) and damage resistance make you very tanky. Scattergun Skills provides damage and reload bonuses. Very fast reload speed (+120% total) compensates for Ammo Stash penalty. Crouch for additional defense and accuracy (Hunker Down). Buckshot Bruiser provides temp health from kills. Food Scavenger synergizes with Heng for trauma management. Down in Front! prevents friendly fire when crouched. Goal: tanky shotgun build with unlimited ammo and high survivability.
