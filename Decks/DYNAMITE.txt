DECK STRATEGY:
--------------

All cards are active from the start, so you benefit from everything immediately.

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (Active from Level Start):
- Massive explosive damage bonuses active (+175% total)
- High offensive inventory capacity (+4 with Hoffman)
- All scavenger abilities active (Copper, Offensive)
- Secondary weapon unlimited ammo active
- Fire damage bonus active (+100%)

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Explosive Damage Group: Demolitions Expert + Grenade Training + Bomb Squad + Pyro
  → Maximum explosive and fire damage output
- Capacity Group: Grenade Pouch + Double Grenade Pouch + Belt Clip + Hoffman's Ready to Rock
  → Maximum offensive item carrying capacity
- Economy Group: Copper Scavenger + Money Grubbers + Offensive Scavenger + Hoffman's Always Prepared
  → Resource generation for purchasing and finding offensive items
- Sustain Group: Pyro + Fire in the Hole! + Canned Goods
  → Temp health generation and health pool

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Professional demolitionist and explosive specialist. Your grenades and Molotovs deal massive damage (+175% total). Use Offensive Scavenger to find items, Money Grubbers and Copper Scavenger for purchasing power. Pyro makes fire damage incredibly powerful (+100%) and gives temp health per kill (+3 temp health per fire kill). Fire in the Hole! provides sustain when throwing items (20 temp health + 25% sprint speed for 5 seconds). With Hoffman, you have +4 offensive inventory slots and generate items from kills. Your goal: eliminate bosses and mutations with explosive damage. Take down Breakers and Ogres with ease using your massive accessory damage bonuses. Use secondary weapon with unlimited ammo for common ridden, save offensive items for mutations and bosses.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Massive damage output (+175%) allows rapid boss/mutation elimination
- High inventory capacity (+4 with Hoffman) means more items available per level
- Economy cards (Copper Scavenger, Money Grubbers) fund item purchases
- Item generation (Offensive Scavenger, Hoffman's Always Prepared) ensures item availability
- Fire damage bonus (+100%) makes Molotovs incredibly effective
- Team explosive damage support (+25%) benefits entire team
- Temp health generation (Pyro, Fire in the Hole!) provides sustain
- Health pool (+50) offsets some vulnerability, but stamina penalty limits mobility
- Requires copper/item management - need to purchase/find items throughout levels

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best offensive items (Frag Grenades, Molotovs for fire damage synergy)
2. Secondary weapon (unlimited ammo, use for common ridden)
3. Primary weapon for mutations (modest damage, focus on items)
4. Copper for purchasing offensive items

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Massive explosive damage (+175% total, +100% fire damage)
- High offensive item capacity (+4 with Hoffman)
- Fire damage specialist (Pyro provides +100% fire damage + temp health per kill)
- Temp health generation from fire kills and throwing items
- Team explosive damage support (+25% team explosive damage)
- Item generation through scavengers and Hoffman's abilities
- Boss elimination specialist (take down Ogres and Breakers with ease)
- Unlimited secondary ammo (Ammo Stash) for common ridden clearing
- Team explosive resistance (+25%) helps entire team

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Lower ammo capacity (-15% from Demolitions Expert, mitigated by Hoffman's Cargo Pockets)
- Stamina penalty from Canned Goods (-25% stamina)
- Requires offensive items to maximize effectiveness (dependent on items/copper)
- Can be expensive (need copper for item purchases)
- Lower personal weapon damage (focus on items, not weapons)
- Requires item management (need to find/purchase items throughout levels)
