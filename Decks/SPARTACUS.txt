PLAYSTYLE

Frontline melee tank that clears common ridden for the team. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire. Prioritize common ridden to stack Berserker buffs and maintain sustain. Your cleave damage from Mean Drunk handles hordes efficiently. Meth Head stacks build quickly (10 swings = max), and Berserker makes you stronger with each kill. Vanguard heals teammates when you kill, making you valuable team support. Stay aggressive - all bonuses are active from level start, and your trauma resistance + healing handles sustain well.


STRENGTHS

- Incredible damage output from the start
- Excellent sustain (health and trauma healing from multiple sources)
- Team support via Vanguard and Down in Front!
- High survivability with trauma resistance (35%, 60% with Sharice)
- Cleave damage handles hordes well
- Scales better as you kill enemies (Berserker stacks)
- All bonuses active from level start


WEAKNESSES

- Limited range capability (melee only)
- Vulnerable to special mutations if caught alone
- Requires good positioning and map knowledge
- Needs team coordination (someone needs to handle snipers/long range)
