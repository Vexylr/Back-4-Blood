TESLA BUILD GUIDE

Experimental tech support build using DLC gadgets from Children of the Worm expansion. Your gadgets replace item slots and cost ammo instead of consumables. This build focuses on team support through healing, crowd control, and mutation damage, but requires careful ammo management.

You're playing support here. The Experimental Stun Gun makes you fragile (50% more damage taken), so stay behind your teammates and let them tank. Your job is using three experimental gadgets to help the team survive and kill mutations efficiently.

Expired T5 costs 75 AR ammo and is your main damage tool. Use it on mutations and bosses, always aiming for weakspots. It deals 20 fire damage to weakspots plus a damage-over-time effect. Don't waste it on common ridden - it's too expensive for what you get.

Ultrasonic Wound Therapy costs 60 Pistol/SMG ammo and provides team healing. When teammates are hurt, position yourself near them and use it to heal 6 health over 7 seconds. Tell your team to group up before using it to get maximum value.

Experimental Stun Gun costs 30 Sniper ammo and gives your bash a stun effect on nearby enemies. It refreshes every 10 seconds. Use it when you're getting swarmed or when mutations get too close. Since it makes you fragile, treat it as a defensive tool.

Ammo management is critical. You're balancing three ammo types constantly - AR ammo for Expired T5, Pistol/SMG ammo for healing, and Sniper ammo for stun gun. AR ammo is the priority since Expired T5 is your most expensive gadget. Tell your team what you need - call out "I need AR ammo for Expired T5" when you're running low. Use Ammo Scavenger actively to find crates. The +75% ammo capacity helps, but you'll still feel the pinch. Don't waste gadget ammo types on your weapons - use your primary weapon for most damage.

You're fragile, so don't play like a hero. Crouch with Down in Front! near your teammates to avoid friendly fire. Stay behind frontliners and support from the back. Move when you need to use gadgets effectively - get near teammates for healing, find good angles for Expired T5 weakspot shots.

Use an LMG or Sniper as your primary weapon. LMG works best because Suppressing Fire procs on it (40% chance to slow enemies) and you get good ammo capacity. Snipers work fine too. Don't use ARs though - you need to save AR ammo for Expired T5.

Your secondary should be a pistol or SMG for commons, but don't waste the ammo. You need 60 Pistol/SMG ammo for your healing gadget, so be careful with it.

Communication matters. Tell your team when you need specific ammo types, when you're about to heal so they can group up, and when you're ready to use Expired T5 on a mutation so they can ping it.

Evangelo is the best cleaner for this build. Born Survivor helps you break out of grabs, which is important since you're fragile. Fit gives +25% stamina regen for constant movement and gadget usage. Light Footed gives +5% team movement speed. Starting with a Molotov gives you backup offensive utility.

Find your weapon early - LMG or Sniper. Check your ammo situation right away - you need all three types. Use Ammo Scavenger to find that first crate quickly. Stay behind your team since you're fragile. Use Expired T5 on mutations and bosses, aiming for weakspots. Use Ultrasonic when people are hurt and tell your team to group up. Use Stun Gun when swarmed or when mutations get close. Save Expired T5 for important targets - don't waste it on commons.

Avoid using Expired T5 on common ridden. It's a waste of 75 AR ammo. Don't play aggressively - you're fragile, stay back. Don't ignore ammo management or you'll run out mid-fight. Don't forget you have gadgets - use them, that's the whole point of the build. Don't stand in front of teammates - let them tank. Don't waste gadget ammo types on your weapons.

You're a gadget-based support. Stay safe, manage your ammo carefully, communicate with your team, and use your experimental tech to help everyone survive. The gadgets are powerful but expensive, so make every use count.
