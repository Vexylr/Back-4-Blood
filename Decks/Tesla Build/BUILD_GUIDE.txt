TESLA BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Experimental tech support build using DLC gadgets from Children of the Worm 
expansion. Your gadgets replace item slots and cost ammo instead of consumables. 
This build focuses on team support through healing, crowd control, and mutation 
damage, but requires careful ammo management.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing support. The Experimental Stun Gun makes you fragile (50% more 
damage taken), so stay behind your teammates and let them tank. Your job is 
using three experimental gadgets to help the team survive and kill mutations 
efficiently.

You're fragile, so don't play like a hero. Crouch with Down in Front! near 
your teammates to avoid friendly fire. Stay behind frontliners and support from 
the back. Move when you need to use gadgets effectively - get near teammates for 
healing, find good angles for Expired T5 weakspot shots.

GADGETS & USAGE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Expired T5 (75 AR ammo)
  → Your main damage tool. Use it on mutations and bosses, always aiming for 
    weakspots. It deals 20 fire damage to weakspots plus a damage-over-time 
    effect. Don't waste it on common ridden - it's too expensive for what you 
    get.

Ultrasonic Wound Therapy (60 Pistol/SMG ammo)
  → Provides team healing. When teammates are hurt, position yourself near them 
    and use it to heal 6 health over 7 seconds. Tell your team to group up 
    before using it to get maximum value.

Experimental Stun Gun (30 Sniper ammo)
  → Gives your bash a stun effect on nearby enemies. It refreshes every 10 
    seconds. Use it when you're getting swarmed or when mutations get too close. 
    Since it makes you fragile, treat it as a defensive tool.

AMMO MANAGEMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is critical. You're balancing three ammo types constantly:
  • AR ammo for Expired T5 (priority - most expensive)
  • Pistol/SMG ammo for healing
  • Sniper ammo for stun gun

Tell your team what you need - call out "I need AR ammo for Expired T5" when 
you're running low. Use Ammo Scavenger actively to find crates. The +75% ammo 
capacity helps, but you'll still feel the pinch. Don't waste gadget ammo types 
on your weapons - use your primary weapon for most damage.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Primary: LMG or Sniper
  → LMG works best because Suppressing Fire procs on it (40% chance to slow 
    enemies) and you get good ammo capacity. Snipers work fine too. Don't use 
    ARs though - you need to save AR ammo for Expired T5.

Secondary: Pistol or SMG
  → Use for commons, but don't waste the ammo. You need 60 Pistol/SMG ammo for 
    your healing gadget, so be careful with it.

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Evangelo
  → Born Survivor helps you break out of grabs (important since you're fragile)
  → Fit gives +25% stamina regen for constant movement and gadget usage
  → Light Footed gives +5% team movement speed
  → Starts with Molotov for backup offensive utility

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Find your weapon early - LMG or Sniper
✓ Check your ammo situation right away - you need all three types
✓ Use Ammo Scavenger to find that first crate quickly
✓ Stay behind your team since you're fragile
✓ Use Expired T5 on mutations and bosses, aiming for weakspots
✓ Use Ultrasonic when people are hurt and tell your team to group up
✓ Use Stun Gun when swarmed or when mutations get close
✓ Save Expired T5 for important targets - don't waste it on commons
✓ Communicate with your team about ammo needs and gadget usage

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Avoid using Expired T5 on common ridden - it's a waste of 75 AR ammo
✗ Don't play aggressively - you're fragile, stay back
✗ Don't ignore ammo management or you'll run out mid-fight
✗ Don't forget you have gadgets - use them, that's the whole point
✗ Don't stand in front of teammates - let them tank
✗ Don't waste gadget ammo types on your weapons

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're a gadget-based support. Stay safe, manage your ammo carefully, 
communicate with your team, and use your experimental tech to help everyone 
survive. The gadgets are powerful but expensive, so make every use count.
