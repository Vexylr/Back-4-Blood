TESLA BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Experimental tech support build using DLC gadgets from Children of the Worm 
expansion. Your gadgets replace item slots and cost ammo instead of consumables. 
This build focuses on team support through healing, crowd control, and mutation 
damage, but requires careful ammo management.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing support. The Experimental Stun Gun makes you fragile (50% more 
damage taken), so stay behind your teammates and let them tank. Your job is 
using three experimental gadgets to help the team survive and kill mutations 
efficiently.

You're fragile (Glass Cannon -30% health), so don't play like a hero. Learn to 
aim and position properly - this is a dynamic deck. Stay behind frontliners and 
support from the back. Move when you need to use gadgets effectively - get near 
teammates for healing, find good angles for Expired T5 weakspot shots. With Pyro 
and Glass Cannon, your T5 explosions are devastating (double fire damage + 25% 
more from Glass Cannon).

GADGETS & USAGE
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Expired T5 (75 AR/LMG ammo)
  → Your main damage tool. With Pyro (+100% fire damage) and Glass Cannon (+25% 
    damage), it deals massive damage to weakspots (~50 fire damage per explosion). 
    Use it on mutations and bosses, always aiming for weakspots. Don't waste it on 
    common ridden - it's too expensive. Use shotgun to balance ammo across all 
    three gadget ammo types.

Ultrasonic Wound Therapy (60 Pistol/SMG ammo)
  → Provides team healing. When teammates are hurt, position yourself near them 
    and use it to heal 6 health over 7 seconds. Tell your team to group up 
    before using it to get maximum value.

Experimental Stun Gun (30 Sniper ammo)
  → Gives your bash a stun effect on nearby enemies. It refreshes every 10 
    seconds. Use it when you're getting swarmed or when mutations get too close. 
    Since it makes you fragile, treat it as a defensive tool.

AMMO MANAGEMENT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is critical. You're balancing three ammo types constantly:
  • AR ammo for Expired T5 (priority - most expensive)
  • Pistol/SMG ammo for healing
  • Sniper ammo for stun gun

Tell your team what you need - call out "I need AR ammo for Expired T5" when 
you're running low. Use Ammo Scavenger actively to find crates. The +75% ammo 
capacity helps, but you'll still feel the pinch. Don't waste gadget ammo types 
on your weapons - use your primary weapon for most damage.

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Primary: Shotgun
  → Best weapon choice for this build. Balances ammo consumption across all three 
    gadget ammo types (AR/LMG for T5, Pistol/SMG for healing, Sniper for stun gun).
    Shotgun ammo is not used by any gadget, so you can use it freely for common 
    ridden without impacting gadget ammo pools.

Secondary: Belgian or any
  → Use for commons. Admin Reload lets you swap weapons for instant reloads, 
    perfect for sustained fire.

RECOMMENDED CLEANER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Tala (Primary)
  → Bleeding attacks cause damage over time, works well with T5 explosions
  → Team effect: +1 Warped Chest spawns per map (team benefit)
  → Can summon Jeff with whistle for additional team utility
  → Starts with Bait Jar
  → Note: Available in River of Blood expansion

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Find your shotgun early - balances ammo for all gadgets
✓ Check your ammo situation right away - you need all three types
✓ Use Admin Reload to swap weapons for instant reloads
✓ Stay behind your team since you're fragile
✓ Use Expired T5 on mutations and bosses, aiming for weakspots (Pyro + Glass 
  Cannon = massive damage)
✓ With Tala: Mark enemies first, then T5 for additional damage
✓ Use Ultrasonic when people are hurt and tell your team to group up
✓ Use Stun Gun when swarmed or when mutations get close
✓ Save Expired T5 for important targets - don't waste it on commons
✓ Communicate with your team about ammo needs and gadget usage
✓ Learn to aim and position - no Down In Front for friendly fire protection

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Avoid using Expired T5 on common ridden - it's a waste of 75 AR/LMG ammo
✗ Don't play aggressively - you're fragile (Glass Cannon), stay back
✗ Don't ignore ammo management or you'll run out mid-fight
✗ Don't forget you have gadgets - use them, that's the whole point
✗ Don't stand in front of teammates - let them tank
✗ Don't waste gadget ammo types on your weapons
✗ Don't rely on Down In Front - learn to aim and position properly

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're a gadget-based support. Stay safe, manage your ammo carefully, 
communicate with your team, and use your experimental tech to help everyone 
survive. The gadgets are powerful but expensive, so make every use count.
