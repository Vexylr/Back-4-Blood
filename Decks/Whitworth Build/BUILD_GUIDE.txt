WHITWORTH BUILD GUIDE

Glass cannon precision damage dealer focused on weakspot damage and mutation elimination. You deal massive damage but have low health - positioning and precision aiming are critical. Your job is eliminating mutations and bosses efficiently through precise weakspot shots.

You're playing DPS. Low health means you're fragile (-15% net health), so stay at range and let your massive damage do the work. Position yourself safely, aim for weakspots, and eliminate mutations before they become a threat.

Stay at range. You're fragile, so find a safe position where you can aim at weakspots without taking damage. Use cover and elevation when you can. Crouch when near teammates with Down in Front! to prevent friendly fire while scoped.

Patient Hunter requires you to aim down sights and hold for 2.25 seconds to max your stacks. This gives you +30% damage when fully scoped, but you need to stay still while aiming. Position safely before scoping in.

Confident Killer stacks on mutation kills, giving you up to +15% damage. Prioritize killing mutations early to build stacks quickly.

If you're using Jim, Clean Kill stacks on precision kills for up to +25% damage, but resets if you take damage. This requires skill - hit weakspots consistently and avoid taking damage to maintain stacks.

Use Assault Rifles or LMGs. Tactical Vest gives +10% damage with these weapons. M1A or Ranch Rifle work great for precision. Snipers also work well and benefit from Suppressing Fire utility. Prioritize weapons with good weakspot damage and manageable recoil.

Your base damage is +50% from cards (+25% Glass Cannon + +2.5% Ammo Pouch + +5% Combat Training + +7.5% Large Caliber + +10% Silver Bullets). Add up to +30% from Patient Hunter when scoped, up to +15% from Confident Killer from mutation kills, and up to +25% from Jim's Clean Kill if you're using Jim. Total potential is up to +130% with Jim, or +115% with Walker.

With Jim, focus on precision weakspot shots and avoid taking damage to maximize Clean Kill stacks. This is a high-skill build that rewards good aim.

With Walker, it's more forgiving. You get consistent +10% damage without needing to maintain precision kill stacks, making it easier to play.

Fresh Bandage heals 15 trauma and restores health at level start - crucial for your low health pool. You have minimal health bonuses, so positioning and avoiding damage is essential.

On Your Mark gives team buffs during hordes - 7.5% ammo restore, 10% move speed while firing, 15% reload speed, and 25% swap speed for 30 seconds. Jim's Seasoned Hunter gives +10% team weakspot damage.

Position at range for optimal weakspot shots. Aim down sights for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks. Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer. Prioritize weakspot shots, especially with Jim. Use Suppressing Fire with LMGs/Snipers for crowd control. Crouch when near teammates.

Don't get caught in close quarters - you're fragile. Don't ignore positioning - low health means mistakes are fatal. Don't waste ammo - manage it carefully. Don't play aggressively - stay back and let your damage do the work. Don't forget to stack Patient Hunter by aiming for 2.25 seconds. With Jim, don't take unnecessary damage or you'll reset Clean Kill stacks.

You're a precision glass cannon. Position safely, aim for weakspots, stack your damage bonuses, and eliminate mutations efficiently. Your massive damage potential makes you valuable for boss fights and mutation elimination, but your low health requires careful positioning and consistent aim.
