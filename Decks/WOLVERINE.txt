CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Multiplayer Safety: Down in Front! + Vanguard
  → Prevents friendly fire and provides team healing
- Sustain Group: Battle Lust + Vanguard + Ignore the Pain + Fresh Bandage
  → Multiple healing sources keep you and team alive
- Damage Group: Mean Drunk + Berserker + Spiky Bits + Ignore the Pain + Sunder
  → Massive damage output from multiple sources
- Defense Group: Body Armor + Durable + Scar Tissue + Spiky Bits + Down in Front!
  → Trauma resistance, damage reduction, and friendly fire protection
- Speed Group: Meth Head + Berserker + Brazen + Slugger
  → Incredible attack speed and stamina efficiency

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Frontline melee tank that clears common ridden for the team. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire. Prioritize common ridden to stack Berserker buffs and maintain sustain. Your cleave damage from Mean Drunk handles hordes efficiently. Meth Head stacks build quickly (10 swings = max), and Berserker makes you stronger with each kill. Vanguard heals teammates when you kill, making you valuable team support. Stay aggressive - all bonuses are active from level start, and your trauma resistance + healing handles sustain well.

- All trauma resistance is active from level start - no need to wait
- Battle Lust provides trauma healing during combat (0.125 trauma per kill)

  → With Holly: +2 Health per kill total (Battle Lust + Grand Slam) for incredible sustain
- Flat damage reduction from Scar Tissue (-1 per hit) is crucial on high difficulties

  → With Holly: +25% Team Stamina (Cardio) + 5% Team Damage Resistance (Tough as Nails)
  → With Sharice: 60% trauma resistance + Makeshift Armor generation
  → With Walker: +10 Team Health + 10% reduced damage from pinged mutations
