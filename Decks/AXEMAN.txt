DECK STRATEGY:
--------------

All cards are active from the start, so you benefit from everything immediately.

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (Active from Level Start):
- All melee damage bonuses active: Mean Drunk (+40%), Spiky Bits (+15 flat)
- All trauma resistance stacks: Durable (+15%), Fanny Pack (+15%) = 30% total (55% with Sharice)
- All attack speed stacks: Brazen (+20%), Slugger (+20%) = 40% base
- Damage resistance while using melee weapon (+20%) active immediately

STACKING MECHANICS (Build During Combat):
- Meth Head: Stacks on each swing (up to 10 stacks = +50% speed/efficiency)

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Melee Damage Group: Mean Drunk + Spiky Bits + Heavy Hitter
  → High damage output with cleave and crowd control
- Sustain Group: Battle Lust + Vanguard + Amped Up + Food Scavenger
  → Multiple healing sources for you and team
- Defense Group: Durable + Fanny Pack + Spiky Bits + Down in Front! + Sharice's Dauntless
  → Trauma resistance, damage resistance, and friendly fire protection
- Speed Group: Meth Head + Brazen + Slugger
  → Incredible attack speed and stamina efficiency when stacked

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Frontline melee specialist using Fire Axe or Claws. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire. Mean Drunk provides cleave for AOE damage, handling hordes efficiently. Meth Head stacks build quickly (10 swings = max stacks). Vanguard heals teammates when you kill (+1 health to all within 10m), and Battle Lust heals you (+1 health + 0.125 trauma per kill). Heavy Hitter provides crowd control with first-hit stumbles. Use Food Scavenger for additional sustain (food restores +3 health). With Sharice, you have +55% trauma resistance (best possible) and Makeshift Armor generation. Your goal: clear common ridden efficiently while healing the team through kills.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Trauma is a major threat - this deck has 30% trauma resistance (55% with Sharice - excellent!)
- All defensive bonuses active from level start - you're tanky from the first engagement
- Cleave damage from Mean Drunk handles hordes efficiently
- Team healing through Vanguard (+1 health to teammates per kill) provides valuable support
- Battle Lust provides personal sustain (+1 health + 0.125 trauma per kill)
- Heavy Hitter provides crowd control (first-hit stumbles)
- Food Scavenger provides additional sustain throughout levels
- With Sharice: 55% trauma resistance is best possible for melee builds

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best melee weapon (Fire Axe or Claws)
2. Secondary weapon for ranged threats (any SMG/Pistol)
3. Medical accessories (share with team when needed)
4. Tool kits (for team utility)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- High melee damage (+40% + 15 flat)
- Cleave damage handles hordes efficiently (Mean Drunk)
- Team healing through Vanguard (+1 health to teammates per kill within 10m)
- Personal sustain through Battle Lust (+1 health + 0.125 trauma per kill)
- Good trauma resistance (30%) - excellent with Sharice (55%)
- Crowd control with Heavy Hitter (first-hit stumbles)
- Fast attack speed when Meth Head stacked (+90% total)
- High stamina efficiency when stacked (+75% total)
- Food sustain through Food Scavenger
- With Sharice: Best trauma resistance possible (55%) + Makeshift Armor generation

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Melee-only (limited range capability)
- Requires good positioning and map knowledge
- Vulnerable to mutations if caught alone
- Needs team support for ranged threats
- Lower health pool (+15 health only)
- Requires maintaining Meth Head stacks for optimal performance
