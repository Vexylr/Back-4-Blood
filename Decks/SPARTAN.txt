DECK STRATEGY:
--------------

All cards are active from the start, so you benefit from everything immediately.

IMMEDIATE EFFECTS (Active from Level Start):
- Massive health pool (110+ health) active from level start
- All trauma resistance stacks: Body Armor (+20%), Durable (+15%) = 35% total (60% with Sharice)
- All damage resistance stacks: Motorcycle Jacket (+5%), Padded Suit (+10%) = 15% total
- Flat damage reduction from Scar Tissue (-1 per hit) active immediately
- Revive speed boost (+200%) active immediately
- Fresh Bandage triggers at start of each level (if added to deck)

CARD GROUPINGS (How They Work Together):
- Revive Group: Smelling Salts + Pep Talk + Dan's Protect the Flock
  → Lightning-fast revives with damage reduction and team buffs
- Health Group: Hydration Pack + Canned Goods + Vitamins + Superior Cardio + Motorcycle Jacket + Padded Suit + Durable + Well Fed
  → Massive health pool (110+ base + 10 team)
- Defense Group: Body Armor + Durable + Scar Tissue + Motorcycle Jacket + Padded Suit
  → Trauma resistance, damage resistance, and flat damage reduction
- Damage Group: Large Caliber Rounds + Combat Training + Ammo Pouch
  → Modest damage output for mutations while maintaining tank role

PLAYSTYLE:
----------

Ultimate tank and revive specialist. Your massive health pool (110+ base health) and damage resistance allow you to stand in the open while reviving teammates. Use Smelling Salts for lightning-fast revives even under heavy fire. Pep Talk makes your revives heal teammates and reduce incoming damage (-4 total damage reduction while reviving). With Dan, you get random effects on every revive and team damage resistance during revives. Your role is to be the last person standing, able to revive the entire team during horde events. Stay near teammates to use your revive bonuses effectively. Position yourself to take aggro and protect squishier teammates.

HIGH DIFFICULTY CONSIDERATIONS:
--------------------------------

- Trauma is a major threat - this deck has 35% trauma resistance (Body Armor + Durable)
  → With Sharice: 60% trauma resistance total (best possible trauma mitigation in game)
- All defensive bonuses active from level start - you're tanky from the first engagement
- Flat damage reduction (-1 per hit) is crucial on high difficulties, especially with common ridden
- Revive speed (+200%) allows you to save teammates even under heavy fire
- Massive health pool means you can absorb damage that would kill other builds
- Damage output is modest - focus on survival and revives, let DPS builds handle mutations
- With Dan: Random effects on every revive can provide clutch saves or damage boosts

EQUIPMENT PRIORITY:
-------------------

1. Best defensive attachments (extra health/resistance)
2. Assault Rifle or LMG for mutation control (penetration helps)
3. Medical accessories (share with team, you're last to go down)
4. Tool kits (for team utility and saferoom upgrades)

STRENGTHS:
----------

- Massive health pool (110+ health) - can take incredible punishment
- Fast revives with Smelling Salts (+200% speed) + with Mom team gets +300% total
- Team support through Well Fed and Pep Talk healing
- High trauma resistance (35%) prevents health pool degradation
  → With Sharice: 60% trauma resistance total (best in game)
- Damage resistance (15%) + flat reduction makes you incredibly tanky
- Pep Talk provides -4 damage reduction during revives (Scar Tissue + Pep Talk)
- Good stumble damage for crowd control
- With Dan: Random revive effects + team damage resistance during revives
- With Mom: +300% total team revive speed (massive utility)

WEAKNESSES:
-----------

- Reduced stamina from Canned Goods (-25%) and Padded Suit (-20% efficiency)
- Lower damage output than DPS builds (focus on survival, not kills)
- Limited mobility due to stamina penalties
- Requires positioning near teammates for maximum effectiveness
- Large health pool means trauma can still accumulate over time (need trauma management)
