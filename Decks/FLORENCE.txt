Group Therapy makes every medical use heal the whole team (+8 health each). Field Surgeon handles trauma (+3 trauma per use), and Antibiotic Ointment provides temp health (+20 temp health per use). Experienced EMT gives powerful buffs (+10% max health/stamina/stamina regen). Charitable Soul keeps you healthy while healing others (50% of healing applies to you). Doc's Field Medic ability gives one free 25 Health heal per teammate per level - use these strategically for emergencies. Position yourself safely, stay mobile with Dash and Energy Bar, and prioritize keeping the team alive. Crouch when near teammates (Down in Front!) to prevent friendly fire while healing.
