SUPPORT BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Mobile supplier and resource generator. Your job is keeping the team stocked 
with ammo, weapons, and items. You're the portable merchant keeping everyone 
supplied and stocked throughout each level.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing support/looter. Use all your scavenger cards to find and generate 
resources throughout each level. Stay mobile with Cross Trainers to cover more 
ground. Help with damage using your weapon cards, but your main focus is 
resource generation and team support.

SCAVENGER ABILITIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have four scavenger abilities:
  • Ammo Scavenger: Senses nearby ammo and gives +1 ammo crate spawn
  • Weapon Scavenger: Senses nearby weapons and makes more spawn
  • Offensive Scavenger: Senses nearby offensive items and makes more spawn
  • Copper Scavenger: Senses nearby copper and makes more spawn

Use these actively throughout each level to find and generate resources for your 
team.

TEAM AMMO SUPPORT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

With Hoffman, you provide +50% team ammo capacity (+35% personal + 10% Ammo for 
All + 15% Cargo Pockets). This massive ammo support prevents ammo starvation for 
the entire team.

COPPER GENERATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Bounty Hunter gives you 10 copper per mutation kill, up to 300 per level. 
Combined with Copper Scavenger making more copper spawn, you generate 
significant copper for team upgrades and item purchases.

EMERGENCY POWER
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Avenge the Fallen gives all teammates 30% damage, 20% reload speed, and 
unlimited ammo for 10 seconds when a teammate goes down. This provides emergency 
power when things go wrong.

TEAM SUSTAIN
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Saferoom Recovery provides team sustain at level start - 15 health, 7 trauma 
damage healed, and 10% ammo refilled. This helps the team start each level in 
good shape.

DAMAGE OUTPUT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

While your focus is support, you still have good damage output (+20% base + 
+3.5% team damage). Use LMGs for Suppressing Fire synergy (40% chance to slow 
enemies) - ALL IN on LMGs.
