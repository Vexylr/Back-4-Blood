SNIPER BUILD GUIDE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Glass cannon precision damage dealer focused on weakspot damage and mutation 
elimination. You deal massive damage but have low health - positioning and 
precision aiming are critical. Your job is eliminating mutations and bosses 
efficiently through precise weakspot shots.

ROLE & POSITIONING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're playing DPS. Low health means you're fragile (-15% net health), so stay 
at range and let your massive damage do the work. Position yourself safely, aim 
for weakspots, and eliminate mutations before they become a threat.

Stay at range. You're fragile, so find a safe position where you can aim at 
weakspots without taking damage. Use cover and elevation when you can. Crouch 
when near teammates with Down in Front! to prevent friendly fire while scoped.

DAMAGE STACKING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Patient Hunter
  → Aim down sights and hold for 2.25 seconds to max your stacks
  → Gives you +30% damage when fully scoped
  → Requires staying still while aiming, so position safely before scoping

Confident Killer
  → Stacks on mutation kills, giving you up to +15% damage
  → Prioritize killing mutations early to build stacks quickly

Clean Kill (Jim only)
  → Stacks on precision kills for up to +25% damage
  → Resets if you take damage
  → Requires skill - hit weakspots consistently and avoid taking damage

DAMAGE CALCULATION
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Base Damage: +50% from cards
  • +25% Glass Cannon
  • +2.5% Ammo Pouch
  • +5% Combat Training
  • +7.5% Large Caliber
  • +10% Silver Bullets

Additional Bonuses:
  • Up to +30% from Patient Hunter (scoped)
  • Up to +15% from Confident Killer (mutation kills)
  • Up to +25% from Jim's Clean Kill (precision kills)

Total Potential:
  • Up to +130% with Jim
  • Up to +115% with Walker

WEAPONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Use Snipers. Stock Pouch gives +10% damage with Snipers and +30% sniper ammo capacity 
weapons. M1A or Ranch Rifle work great for precision. Snipers also work well 
and benefit from Suppressing Fire utility. Prioritize weapons with good 
weakspot damage and manageable recoil.

RECOMMENDED CLEANERS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Jim (Primary)
  → Focus on precision weakspot shots and avoid taking damage to maximize 
    Clean Kill stacks. This is a high-skill build that rewards good aim.

Walker (Alternative)
  → More forgiving with consistent +10% damage. No need to maintain precision 
    kill stacks, making it easier to play.

SUSTAIN & UTILITY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Fresh Bandage
  → Heals 15 trauma and restores health at level start - crucial for your low 
    health pool. You have minimal health bonuses, so positioning and avoiding 
    damage is essential.

On Your Mark
  → Gives team buffs during hordes: 7.5% ammo restore, 10% move speed while 
    firing, 15% reload speed, and 25% swap speed for 30 seconds

Jim's Seasoned Hunter
  → Gives +10% team weakspot damage

KEY STRATEGIES
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✓ Position at range for optimal weakspot shots
✓ Aim down sights for 2.25 seconds to max Patient Hunter stacks
✓ Focus mutations first to stack Confident Killer
✓ Prioritize weakspot shots, especially with Jim
✓ Use Suppressing Fire with LMGs/Snipers for crowd control
✓ Crouch when near teammates

CRITICAL TIPS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

✗ Don't get caught in close quarters - you're fragile
✗ Don't ignore positioning - low health means mistakes are fatal
✗ Don't waste ammo - manage it carefully
✗ Don't play aggressively - stay back and let your damage do the work
✗ Don't forget to stack Patient Hunter by aiming for 2.25 seconds
✗ With Jim: Don't take unnecessary damage or you'll reset Clean Kill stacks

SUMMARY
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You're a precision glass cannon. Position safely, aim for weakspots, stack your 
damage bonuses, and eliminate mutations efficiently. Your massive damage 
potential makes you valuable for boss fights and mutation elimination, but your 
low health requires careful positioning and consistent aim.
