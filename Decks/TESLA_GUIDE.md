# TESLA Build Guide

Experimental gadget build using DLC stuff from Children of the Worm. Basically you're running around with gadgets that replace your normal items and they cost ammo instead. It's pretty cool if you can manage the ammo, which is the tricky part.

**Difficulty:** No Hope  
**Playstyle:** Support  
**Expansion:** Children of the Worm (required)

## Cleaners

### Use Evangelo

His breakout ability is clutch since you're fragile as hell. The extra stamina regen is nice for positioning, and starting with a Molotov is always useful. Plus he gives the team +5% move speed which is nice.

If you don't have Evangelo, Hoffman works too if your team needs more ammo, or Karlee if you want hazard detection.

---

## Weapons

**Primary: LMG or Sniper**

LMG works best because Suppressing Fire procs on it and you get good ammo capacity. Snipers work too if you prefer. The key is you need something with good ammo economy because your gadgets eat ammo like crazy.

**Why not ARs?** Expired T5 costs 75 AR ammo. That's your main damage gadget, so you want to save AR ammo for it. LMGs and Snipers work with Suppressing Fire anyway, so it works out better.

**Secondary:** Just use a pistol or SMG for commons. Don't waste the ammo though—you need 60 Pistol/SMG ammo for your healing gadget.

## The Gadgets

### Expired T5 (75 AR ammo)

This is your big damage dealer. Hits weakspots for 20 fire damage plus a DOT. Use it on mutations and bosses, not commons. It's expensive, so make every shot count.

Pro tip: Wait for mutations to stop moving before you use it. Hitting a moving weakspot is annoying.

### Ultrasonic Wound Therapy (60 Pistol/SMG ammo)

Heals your team for 6 health over 7 seconds. Use it when people are hurt, obviously. The range isn't huge, so tell your team to group up if they need healing.

Don't be stingy with it—6 health over time is pretty solid, especially with the healing efficiency buffs. Just watch your ammo.

### Experimental Stun Gun (30 Sniper ammo, refreshes every 10 seconds)

Your bash stuns enemies in a small area. This is your "oh shit" button when things get close. Refreshes every 10 seconds, so use it pretty frequently.

**Important:** This makes you FRAGILE. You take 50% more damage, so don't play like you're a tank. Stay behind your teammates.

---

## How to Play

### Early Game

Find an LMG or Sniper asap. Check your ammo—you need all three types (AR, Pistol/SMG, Sniper). Use Ammo Scavenger to find that first crate. Stay behind your team since you're fragile.

### During Levels

**Ammo management is everything.** You're constantly balancing three different ammo types. Tell your team what you need—if you're running low on AR ammo for Expired T5, speak up. The +75% ammo capacity helps, but it's still tight.

Use Expired T5 on mutations and bosses. Use Ultrasonic when people are hurt. Use Stun Gun when you're getting swarmed. Rotate through them based on what's happening.

**Positioning:** You're fragile, so don't be a hero. Crouch with Down in Front! near your teammates. Let the tank/frontliners take the aggro while you support from the back.

### Boss Fights

Save Expired T5 for the boss weakspot. Heal your team before the boss spawns if possible. Use Stun Gun to create openings. Communicate with your team—tell them when you're using gadgets.

## Team Stuff

### Ideal Team

You want a tank up front (someone running SPARTAN works great), a DPS or two, and maybe a dedicated healer or supplier. You're the weird gadget support, so don't try to fill multiple roles.

### Communication

Tell your team:
- "I need AR ammo for Expired T5" when you're low
- "Group up for healing" before using Ultrasonic
- "I'm fragile, stay in front of me" as a positioning reminder
- "Expired T5 ready for [mutation]" so they know to ping it

## Ammo Tips

**Priority order:**
1. AR ammo (most expensive at 75 per Expired T5)
2. Pistol/SMG ammo (60 per healing)
3. Sniper ammo (30 per stun, but you use it more often)

**What helps:**
- Ammo Scavenger gives you +1 ammo crate spawn and lets you sense ammo
- The +75% ammo capacity from Ammo Pouch and Ammo Belt gives you more wiggle room
- With Evangelo, you can use your weapons efficiently while saving ammo for gadgets

**Don't:**
- Waste gadget ammo on commons—use your primary weapon
- Hoard ammo when your team needs help
- Ignore ammo crates

---

## Important Cards

**The gadgets:** Expired T5, Ultrasonic Wound Therapy, Experimental Stun Gun. These are your whole thing.

**Must-haves:**
- Down in Front! (prevents friendly fire—essential for multiplayer)
- Ammo Scavenger (you'll run out of ammo without it)
- Copper Scavenger (copper for upgrades is always useful)

**Sustain:**
- Food Scavenger (extra health from food)
- Sadist (temp health when teammates take damage)
- Well Rested (team overheal and healing efficiency)

**Weapon stuff:**
- Suppressing Fire (crowd control with LMG/Sniper)
- Large Caliber Rounds (+200% penetration is nice)
- Combat Training (damage and stumble utility)

---

## Mistakes to Avoid

- Using Expired T5 on commons (waste of 75 AR ammo)
- Playing too aggressively (you're fragile, stay back)
- Ignoring ammo management (you'll run out mid-fight)
- Forgetting you have gadgets (use them, that's the whole point)
- Not communicating with team (coordination matters)
- Standing in front of teammates (let them tank)

---

## Advanced Stuff

**Gadget combos:**
Stun Gun into Expired T5 is solid—stunned mutations are easier to hit. Heal your team before major fights. Use Expired T5 when mutations are slowed by Suppressing Fire.

**Positioning:**
Crouch behind teammates with Down in Front!. Position yourself for good Expired T5 angles. Stay close enough to heal but far enough to not get swarmed.

**Ammo efficiency:**
Use your primary weapon (LMG/Sniper) for most damage. Only use your secondary in emergencies. Call out ammo needs early, don't wait until you're completely empty.

**Team coordination:**
Ping mutations before using Expired T5. Tell people when you're healing so they group up. Let them know when you're low on specific ammo types.

## The Bottom Line

You're support. Your job is keeping people alive, controlling crowds, and killing mutations efficiently—not being the frontliner. Stay safe, watch your ammo, and talk to your team. The gadgets are powerful, but expensive. Use them wisely.

The build is fun if you like managing resources and supporting the team. Just remember you're fragile, so play accordingly.
