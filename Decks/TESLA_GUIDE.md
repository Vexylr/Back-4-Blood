## Recommended Cleaners

### PRIMARY: EVANGELO ⭐

**Why Evangelo?**
- **Born Survivor**: Break out of grabs with +75% speed (crucial when Experimental Stun Gun makes you FRAGILE)
- **Light Footed** (Team): +5% Team Movement Speed
- **Fit**: +25% Stamina Regen (helps with positioning and gadget usage)
- **Firestarter**: Starts with Molotov (backup offensive item)

Evangelo's mobility and breakout ability synergize perfectly with a build that makes you fragile. The extra stamina regen helps you reposition to use gadgets effectively.

### Alternative Cleaners

- **Hoffman**: If your team needs more ammo/offensive item generation
- **Karlee**: If you need hazard detection and utility speed
- **Doc**: If your team needs more healing support

## Recommended Weapons

### PRIMARY WEAPON OPTIONS

**Best Choice: LMG (M249, RPK)**
- Works with Suppressing Fire card (40% chance to slow Ridden)
- High ammo capacity (important for gadget usage)
- Good sustained damage
- Efficient ammo consumption

**Alternative: Sniper Rifle**
- Works with Suppressing Fire card
- High damage per shot (ammo efficient)
- Good for mutation elimination

**Why NOT ARs?**

## Gameplay Strategy

### Early Game (Level Start)

1. **Check ammo**: Make sure you have diverse ammo types (AR, Pistol/SMG, Sniper)
2. **Find your weapon**: Prioritize LMG or Sniper Rifle
3. **Position safely**: You're FRAGILE, so stay behind the tank/frontliners
4. **Use Ammo Scavenger**: Find that first ammo crate early

### Mid-Game (During Levels)

1. **Ammo Management is CRITICAL**
   - Collect all ammo types—don't ignore any
   - Coordinate with team: "I need AR ammo for Expired T5"
   - Use Ammo Scavenger actively—you get +1 ammo crate spawn

2. **Gadget Rotation**
   - **Expired T5**: Save for mutations/bosses
   - **Ultrasonic Wound Therapy**: Use when team health drops
   - **Experimental Stun Gun**: Use every 10 seconds when needed

3. **Positioning**
   - Crouch with Down in Front! near teammates
   - Stay behind frontliners (you're FRAGILE)
   - Move to use gadgets effectively (near teammates for healing, good angles for Expired T5)

### Late Game / Boss Fights

1. **Save Expired T5** for boss weakspot damage
2. **Heal team** before boss spawns (Ultrasonic Wound Therapy)
3. **Use Experimental Stun Gun** to create openings
4. **Coordinate with team**: Call out when you're using gadgets

## Team Composition Synergy

### IDEAL TEAM SETUP

1. **TESLA (You)**: Support through gadgets
2. **Tank** (SPARTAN build): Frontline, takes aggro (protects your fragile self)
3. **DPS** (WHITWORTH/SPRINGFIELD): Kills mutations efficiently
4. **Healer** (FLORENCE) or **Supplier** (QUARTERMASTER): Additional support/resources

### What Your Team Should Know

- **"I need AR ammo for Expired T5"** - Call out when low
- **"Group up for healing"** - When using Ultrasonic Wound Therapy
- **"I'm fragile, stay in front"** - Positioning reminder
- **"Expired T5 ready for [mutation name]"** - Coordination

## Ammo Management Tips

### Ammo Priority (Most Important First)

1. **AR Ammo**: Expired T5 costs 75—most expensive gadget
2. **Pistol/SMG Ammo**: Ultrasonic Wound Therapy costs 60
3. **Sniper Rifle Ammo**: Experimental Stun Gun costs 30 (but use frequently)

### Cards That Help

- **Ammo Scavenger**: +1 ammo crate spawn, sense nearby ammo
- **Ammo Pouch** (+25%) + **Ammo Belt** (+50%) = **+75% ammo capacity**
- With Evangelo: You can use weapons efficiently while saving ammo for gadgets

### Ammo Etiquette

- **DON'T** waste gadget ammo on common Ridden
- **DO** use your primary weapon (LMG/Sniper) for most damage
- **DO** call out when you need specific ammo types
- **DO** prioritize ammo crates when you see them (Ammo Scavenger helps)
